\section{Introduction}

Most geotechnical analyses involve failure prediction and the design of 
structures that can safely withstand applied loads. However, it is very 
important to study the post-failure behaviour to mitigate risk posed by 
geophysical and gravity-driven flows, such as landslides, avalanches, slope 
failures, and debris flows. Granular flows are complex problems in continuum 
mechanics for which no closed-form solution exists. Hence, it is essential to 
develop alternative solution schemes which are capable of simulating failure 
mechanisms and post-failure dynamics of granular media. 

The dynamics of a homogeneous granular flow involve at least three distinct 
scales: the \textit{microscopic scale}, which is characterised by the contact 
between grains; the \textit{meso-scale} that represents micro-structural 
effects such as grain rearrangement; and the \textit{macroscopic scale}, where 
geometric correlations can be observed (\cref{fig:multiscale}). Conventionally, 
granular flows are modelled as continua because they exhibit many collective 
phenomena. However, on a grain scale, granular materials exhibit complex 
solid-like and/or fluid-like behaviours. Recent studies, however, suggest that 
a continuum law may be unable to capture the effect of inhomogeneities at the 
grain scale level, such as orientation of force chains. Discrete element 
methods (DEM) are capable of simulating these micro-structural effects; 
however, they are computationally expensive.

\section{Continuum modelling of granular flow}

Numerical techniques prove to be the most powerful way for modelling the 
granular assembly. It is important to argue why it is acceptable to model the 
granular materials as a continuum. Even at the outset, it may appear that 
such a treatment is objectionable. The most blatant reason is the fact 
that the micro-constituents of granular matter, i.e. the individual grains, are 
not small enough to warrant a continuum description~\citep{Kamrin2007}. Typical 
continuum laws are only expected to apply when there is a strong separation of 
scales, i.e. separation of the micro-scale from the macro-scale, in the flow 
geometry. Continuum mechanics rely on the fundamental notion of a 
representative volume element, in which properties averaged over discrete 
grains exhibit deterministic relationships. Recent work on granular 
materials suggests that a continuum law may be incapable of revealing 
inhomogeneities at the grain-scale level~\citep{Rycroft2009b}. Microscopic 
features of dense granular materials which seem to defy a simple continuum
description include (i) complex, fractal networks of force chains, which 
are inhomogeneous down to the grain level~\citep{Goldhirsch2003}, (ii) buckling 
of force chains and instabilities in shear band, (iii) anomalous, 
non-collisional particle dynamics and proximity to the jamming 
transition, where geometrical packing constraints suppress any dynamics, and 
(iv) a wide range of dynamic response, from liquid-like to solid-like 
behaviours~\citep{Jaeger1996,Aranson2001,Aranson2002}. The first three
points cast serious doubt on the prospects of a continuum law. The third point 
entails that the full stress tensor must be described, and it may depend on 
strain, deformation rate, and material variables that can evolve during the 
process~\citep{Rycroft2009b}.

Granular materials exhibit many collective phenomena \citep{Jaeger1996}. 
However, no continuum model is yet capable of describing behaviours such as 
granular fingering on rough slopes, plug flow and the 
occurrence of localised shear bands in the granular materials. Most 
constitutive models, even in the simple case 
of dry granular flows, cannot describe the entire range of flow from solid to 
fluid. In certain cases, granular flow is modelled as a fluid behaviour. 
Continuum models that are based on averaging techniques applied to
representative volume elements are mostly utilised in problems involving 
quasi-static conditions. The fundamental question is how to meaningfully model 
granular materials which exhibit complex phenomena. 

The oldest approach involves modelling the granular material as a rigid solid, 
which behaves as an ideal Coulomb material and undergoes failure if the ratio 
of the shear stress to the normal stress in any plane reaches a critical value 
of the Coulomb internal friction coefficient $\mu$. The stress is determined 
based on the mechanical equilibrium of the system along with the hypothesis of 
\textit{incipient yield}, i.e. the yield criterion is attained everywhere at 
all times (in a ``\textit{limit-state}'')~\citep{Rycroft2009b}. The fundamental 
assumption of a limit-state stress field at incipient yield everywhere is 
questionable. Granular flows can contain regions of stress lying within the 
yield surface. In fact, discrete-element simulations show that the grains in 
this region essentially remain static~\citep{Staron2005}. Some of the 
limitations of the Mohr-Coulomb plasticity in modelling granular materials 
include linearisation of the limit-stress envelope and the inability to account 
for variable volume change characteristics depending on pre-consolidation 
pressure during shearing, predicting unrealistic negative pore-pressure upon 
shearing due to constant rate of dilation, and the inability to predict 
compressive plastic strains in soft-soils. Mohr–Coulomb plasticity has been 
used extensively in engineering applications~\citep{Nedderman1992}, but the 
general solution requires sophisticated numerical techniques to capture 
shock-like discontinuities in stress and velocity, which arise even in 
relatively simplistic geometries. 

The coaxiality feature of Mohr-Coulomb plasticity 
is useful in describing debris flows. The principle of coaxiality
claims that material should flow by extending along the
minor principal stress direction and contracting along the major principal 
stress direction; the principal planes of stress are aligned with the principal 
planes of strain-rate. Granular materials deform solely based 
on the alignment of the principal planes. Under this assumption, the major 
principal plane is usually vertical due to gravity, and the coaxiality rule 
requires the material to expand horizontally, as is the case for granular 
column collapse. However, the coaxiality can be troubling depending on the 
circumstances. Consider a flat-bottomed quasi-2D silo with smooth 
side-walls. Under standard filling procedures, the walls provide only enough 
pressure to keep the grains from sliding farther out.  For example, in a slow 
dense granular flow through a silo, the principal plane remains vertical and 
coaxiality requires the granular material to expand horizontally, thus 
making it geometrically impossible for the granular material to converge and 
exit through the orifice. Depending on the boundary conditions, Mohr-Coulomb 
plasticity can result in discontinuities or jumps in the velocity and stress 
fields~\citep{Rycroft2006}. Coaxiality can also violate principles of 
thermodynamics. Coaxiality only ensures that there is no shear strain-rate in 
the principal stress reference frame and actually does not directly enforce 
that the two principal strain-rate axes and the axis of maximal compression 
(i.e. the major principal strain-rate direction) must align with the major 
principal stress direction.

\citet{Roscoe1970} showed that the principal axes of strain rate and of 
stress are generally not coincidental during simple shear tests of sand. 
Despite 
the plastic character of the flow, the flow rules obtained by employing the 
rheological concept of perfect plasticity to granular materials (perfect soil 
plasticity) are definitely inadequate for a description of fully-developed 
shear flow. The non-coaxiality of the tensors of stress and strain increment 
are able to explain the shear flow behaviour. The rotations of the principal 
stress 
and the principal plastic strain rate are found to be non-coaxial, particularly 
at the early stage of loading. However, the axes tend 
to become coincidental at large shear strains~\citep{Yu2006}, which are common 
in geophysical flows.

Advanced elasto-plastic models based on the \textit{critical state} theory
provide a better representation of granular flows in a quasi-static regime, but 
do not have any rate-dependent effects that are associated with rapid granular 
flows. At large shear strains, such as geophysical flows, the granular mass is 
considered to be in a critical state. Another continuum-based model is the 
partial fluidisation model, which uses a set of equations that describes the 
flow velocity and the shear stresses along with an auxiliary order parameter to 
predict granular flow behaviour. The order parameter of the granular media 
controls the size of the viscous-like contribution to the stress tensor and 
describes the transition between the flowing and the static components of the 
granular system~\citep{Aranson2001}. A constitutive model, which considers the 
solid fraction as the main microscopic parameter for describing dense granular 
flow, was proposed by~\citet{Josserand2004}. The stress in the granular 
material 
is divided into a rate-dependent part representing the reboundless impact 
between grains and a rate-independent part associated with longer contacts, 
i.e. quasi-static regime. Although the model captures shear localization 
behaviour, it fails to describe granular flow behaviour at rough 
boundaries. In the basal or frictional layer, grain rotation plays an 
important role. This rotation causes the grain stress tensor to be 
non-symmetric and 
results in a perturbed profile in the solid fraction, phenomena which require 
specific  
modelling~\citep{Josserand2004}.

In the case of saturated/submerged soil conditions, most continuum 
techniques do not consider fully coupled behaviours. Rather, they consider 
the soil-fluid mixture as a single phase material. However, modelling of pore 
pressure dissipation is important to capture accurate flow behaviour, 
especially in submarine conditions, where they play a crucial role in the flow 
dynamics. Presence of ambient fluid may retard the flow due to viscous drag or 
accelerate the flow through a lubrication effect. Fully coupled constitutive 
models are essential to realistically capture the initiation and propagation of 
rapid granular flows.

Granular materials are composed of distinct grains which interact only at 
the contact points. It is assumed that the deformations of individual grains 
are negligible in comparison with the deformation of the granular assembly as 
a whole. The latter deformation is primarily due to the movement of the grains 
as rigid bodies. Therefore, it can be argued that precise modelling of grain 
deformation is not necessary to obtain a good approximation of the overall 
mechanical behaviour. An Eulerian grain-level continuum model describes the 
response of individual grains to the applied loads. However, continuum 
mechanics solves over the whole domain using initial and boundary conditions 
appropriate for the problem. Hence, continuum models are still widely used to 
solve engineering problems associated with granular materials and flows.

\subsection{Mesh-based and mesh-free techniques}

In continuum mechanics, there are two different descriptions of the 
deformation of a continuum, namely Lagrangian and Eulerian 
descriptions. In the Lagrangian description, the movement of the continuum is 
specified as a function of the material coordinates and time. This particle 
description is often applied in solid mechanics. The Eulerian description, on 
the other hand, focuses on the current configuration focusing on a fixed point 
in space as time progresses, instead of individual particles as they move 
through space and time. The Eulerian description is commonly used for 
describing fluid flows where kinematic properties are of particular interest. 

Conventional mesh-based Lagragian approaches, such as the Finite Element Method 
or the Finite Difference Method, are capable of modelling history-dependent 
material behaviour and have well-defined free surfaces. However, they require 
complex re-meshing and remapping of variables, causing additional errors in 
simulating large deformation problems~\citep{Li2002}. Unlike in  Lagrangian 
FEM, the computational mesh in the Eulerian FEM is kept spatially fixed while 
the material is deforming in time. The Eulerian description produces the 
capability for handling large deformations without the problem of mesh 
distortion. As the computational mesh is completely decoupled from the 
material, convective terms appear in the Eulerian 
FEM, introducing numerical difficulties because of their non-symmetrical 
properties~\citep{Donea1982}. Additionally, Eulerian FEM is difficult to use
with history-dependent constitutive models. The Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian 
(CEL) method is an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method that attempts to 
capture the advantages of both the Lagrangian and the Eulerian method in 
modelling large deformation problems in geomechanics~\citep{Qiu2011}. This 
approach involves solving the governing equations in a Lagrangian step, thus 
obtaining the material displacement, followed by the Eulerian step where a 
new mesh is generated and and the variables are transferred to the the new 
mesh. This requires greater computation time. 

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{NumericalMethods}
\caption{Difference between mesh-based and mesh-free techniques in modelling 
large deformation flow.}
\label{fig:NumericalMethods}
\end{figure}

An alternative to the mesh-based approach is the use of mesh-less Lagrangian 
methods 
(\cref{fig:NumericalMethods}) where the nodes representing the solids transform 
as the continuum deforms, avoiding the problem of mesh distortion, i.e. the 
nodes representing the solids can move freely within the domain. Mesh-free 
methods, such as Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Material Point Method, are 
not constrained by the mesh size and mesh distortion effects, and hence can be 
effectively used in simulating large deformation problems, such as debris flow 
and submarine landslides.

The element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is a relatively new mesh-less 
method, in which the trial functions for the weak form are constructed using 
moving least squares interpolation~\citep{Belytschko1994}. The particle finite 
element method (PFEM) is another mesh-less method that involves mesh-less 
finite element interpolation. In PFEM, the nodal points represent the 
particles and the computational mesh is constructed by connecting these points. 
The mesh is then used to solve the governing equations in a Lagrangian fashion. 
In PFEM, large deformation requires frequent re-meshing~\citep{Kafaji2013}.

Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics is the oldest mesh-free technique, in which the 
domain is discretised into particles that have a spatial distance, called the 
\textit{smoothing length} over which the material properties are ``smoothed'' 
by a kernel function. SPH was developed to solve astrophysical 
problems~\citep{Monaghan2005}. SPH has been applied in geomechanics for solving 
large deformation problems~\citep{Augarde2009,Maeda2010,Mori2008}. Although SPH 
has been successfully used, it has a few drawbacks: SPH exhibits spatial 
instabilities, as a consequence of the point-wise 
integration~\citep{Bonet2000}, insufficient neighbouring particles causes 
inconsistencies, and it is computationally expensive as a result of the search 
for the neighbouring particles~\citep{Bandara2013}.

\section{Material Point Method (MPM)}
The Material Point Method (MPM)~\citep{Sulsky1994,Sulsky1995} is a particle 
based method that represents the material as a collection of \textit{material 
points}, and their deformations are determined by \textit{Newton's laws of 
motion}. \citet{Sulsky1994} extended the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) 
method~\citep{Harlow1964} to computational solid mechanics by taking advantage 
of the combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The MPM is a 
hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, which uses moving material points and 
computational nodes on a background mesh. This approach is very effective 
particularly in the context of large 
deformations~\citep{Mackenzie-Helnwein2010,Shin2010a,Mast2014,Andersen2010,Zhang2009,Bandara2013}.
Although not derived directly from what are classically considered as mesh-free 
or mesh-less methods, MPM is still considered as a mesh-free approach, 
primarily because the initial discretisation of the material does not involve a 
polygonal tessellation, as in the Finite Element Method. However, MPM utilises 
a background mesh to perform differentiation, integration, and to solve 
equations of motion~\citep{Steffen2008}. The background mesh can be of any 
form, though for computational efficiency a Cartesian lattice is adopted.

grid cells.}

A typical 2D discretisation of a solid body is shown in~\cref{fig:MPM}. The 
grey circles in~\cref{fig:MPM} are the material points $x_{p}$, where 
`\textit{p}' represents a material point, and the computational nodes are the 
points of intersection of the grid (denoted as $X_{i}$, where \textit{i} 
represents a computational node). MPM involves discretising the domain, 
$\Omega$, with a set of material points. The material points are assigned an 
initial value of position, velocity, mass, volume, and stress, denoted as 
$\mathbf{x}_{p},\mbox{  } \mathbf{\mathit{v}}_{p},\mbox{  } \mathit{m}_{p}, 
\mbox{  }\mathbf{V}_{p}\mbox{ and }\sigma_{p} $, respectively. Depending on the 
material being simulated, additional parameters, like pressure, temperature, 
pore-water pressure, etc., are specified at the material points. The material 
points are assumed to be within the computational grid which for ease of 
computation, is assumed to be a Cartesian lattice (\cref{fig:MPM}). At 
every time step $\mathit{t}_{k}$, the MPM computation cycle involves projecting 
the data, such as position, mass, and velocity, from the material points to the 
computational grid using the standard nodal basis functions, called the 
\textit{shape functions}, derived from the position of the particle with 
respect to the grid. Gradient terms are calculated on the computational grid,
and the governing equation, i.e. the equation of motion, is solved with the 
updated position and velocity values mapping back to the material points. 
The mesh is reinitialised to its original state and the computational cycle is 
repeated. 

\subsection{Discrete formulation of the governing equations}
The governing differential equation for a continuum is derived from the 
conservation of mass and momentum:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mass}
\frac{\partial \rho}{dt}\rho \Delta \cdot \mathbf{\mathit{v}} & = 0 \,, \\   
 \label{eq:mom}
 \rho a & = \Delta \cdot \sigma + \rho \mathbf{\mathit{b}} \,,
\end{align}
where $\rho (\mathbf{x},t)$ is the mass density, $\mathit{\mathbf{v}} 
(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the velocity,  $\mathit{\mathbf{a}} (\mathbf{x},t)$ is the 
acceleration,  $\sigma (\mathbf{x},t)$ is the Cauchy's stress tensor, and  
$\mathit{\mathbf{b}} (\mathbf{x},t)$ is the body force. The vector 
\textbf{\textit{x}} represents the current position of any material point in 
the continuum at time \textit{t}. In MPM, the continuum body is discretised 
into a finite number of material points, $\mathit{N}_{p}$. Let 
$\mathit{\mathbf{x}}_{p}^{t}$ $(\mathit{p}=1,2,\dots,\mathit{N}_{p})$ denote 
the current position of material point \textit{p} at time t.
Each material point, at any given time \textit{t}, has an associated mass 
$\mathit{m}_{p}^{t}$, density $\rho_{p}^{t}$, velocity 
$\mathbf{\mathit{v}}_{p}^{t}$, Cauchy stress tensor $\sigma_{p}^{t}$, strain 
$\epsilon_{p}^{t}$, and other necessary internal state variables based on the 
adopted constitutive model. These material points provide a Lagrangian 
description of the continuum body. Since material points have a fixed mass at 
all times,~\cref{eq:mass} is satisfied. The data from the material points 
are mapped on to the nodes of the computational grid, where the discrete form 
of~\cref{eq:mom} is described. The weak form of~\cref{eq:mom} is 
obtained 
by multiplying~\cref{eq:mom} with a test function 
$\mathbf{\mathit{w}}(\mathbf{x},t)$:
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega}\rho \mathit{\mathbf{w}} \cdot \mathbf{\mathit{a}} 
\mathit{d}\Omega = - \int_{\Omega} \rho {\sigma}^{s} : \Delta 
\mathit{\mathbf{w}} \mathit{d}\Omega + \int_{{\partial \Omega}_{\tau}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{w}} \cdot \tau \mathit{d} \mathit{S} + \int_{\Omega}\rho 
\mathbf{\mathit{w}} \cdot \mathbf{b} \mathit{d} \Omega \,,
\label{eq:weak}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^{s}$ is the specific stress (i.e. stress divided by mass density, 
$\sigma^{s} = \sigma / \rho$), $\Omega$ is the current configuration of the 
continuum and $\tau$ is the surface traction. Eq~\ref{eq:weak} is obtained by 
applying the divergence theorem, similar to the standard procedure adopted in 
Finite Element Methods \citep{Sulsky1994,Sulsky1995, Chen2002}. The 
differential volume and the surface elements are denoted by d$\Omega$ and 
\textit{dS}, respectively. 

As the whole continuum is discretised into a finite set of material points, the 
mass density can be written as
\begin{equation}
\rho(\mathbf{x},t)=\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}}
{\mathit{m}_{p}\delta(\mathbf{\mathit{x}}-\mathbf{\mathit{x}}_{p}^{t})} \,,
\label{eq:massd}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function. Substituting~\cref{eq:massd} 
in~\cref{eq:weak}, the sum of quantities of material points can be evaluated 
as
\begin{align}
\nonumber
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}} 
\mathit{m}_{p}[\mathbf{\mathit{w}}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t) \cdot 
\mathbf{a}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t)] = & 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}} \mathit{m}_{p} 
[-\sigma^{s}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t): \Delta 
\mathbf{\mathit{w}}|_{\mathit{x}_{p}^{t}} \\ 
& + \mathbf{\mathit{w}}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t) \cdot 
\tau^{s}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t)h^{-1} +  
\mathbf{\mathit{w}}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t) \cdot 
\mathbf{\mathit{b}}(\mathit{x}_{p}^{t},t)] \,,
\label{eq:MPM}
\end{align}
where \textit{h} is the thickness of the boundary layer upon which the traction 
boundary conditions are enforced. Since the continuum body is moving in an 
arbitrary computational mesh, all the boundary conditions are carried by the 
boundary particles. If only one boundary particle is located in a cell, the 
cell boundary becomes a part of the continuum boundary, and the cell size 
represents the thickness of boundary layer. If both boundary and interior
particles of the continuum are located in a cell, this cell becomes a mixed 
one. However, the mixed cell is still treated as a boundary cell. In other 
words, the interior particles temporarily become boundary ones. To avoid
numerical errors, therefore, small cells must be used to contain only boundary 
particles if possible, and the boundary conditions are enforced in each 
time step.

It can be noted from~\cref{eq:MPM} that the interactions between different 
material points are reflected only through the gradient terms. In MPM, a 
background computational mesh is used to calculate the gradient terms. The 
computational mesh is constructed using 2-node cells for 1-D, 4-node cells for 
2-D, and 8-node cells for 3-D problems. These elements are used to define the 
standard nodal basis functions, $\mathit{N}_{i}(\mathbf{x})$, associated with 
the spatial nodes $\mathbf{\mathit{x}}_{i}(t), 
\mathit{i}=1,2,\dots,\mathit{N}_{n}$, where $\mathit{N}_{n}$ represents the 
total number of mesh nodes. The nodal basis functions are assembled by using 
the conventional finite-element shape functions~\citep{Chen2002}. The 
coordinates of any material point in a cell can be represented by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathit{x}}_{p}^{t} = \sum\limits_{\mathit{i}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{x}}_{\mathit{i}}^{t}\mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}}(\mathbf{x}_{p}^{t}) 
\,.
\label{eq:x}
\end{equation}
%
Similarly the nodal displacements, velocity and acceleration of any material 
point in a cell are represented using the basis functions. Thus, the test 
function must be of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathit{w}}_{p}^{t} = \sum\limits_{\mathit{i}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{w}}_{\mathit{i}}^{t}\mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}}(\mathbf{w}_{p}^{t}) 
\,.
\label{eq:wtest}
\end{equation}
%
\Cref{eq:x,eq:wtest} ensure that the associated vectors are 
continuous across the cell boundary. However, the gradient of these functions 
is not continuous, due to the use of linear shape functions. 
Substituting~\cref{eq:x} and~\cref{eq:wtest} into~\cref{eq:MPM}, the weak form 
of the equation of motion reduces to
%
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\mathit{j}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}} m_{\mathit{ij}}^{\mathit{t}} 
\mathbf{a}_{\mathit{j}}^{\mathit{t}} = \mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{int,\mathit{t}} 
+ \mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{ext,\mathit{t}} \,,
\label{eq:fmaMPM}
\end{equation}
%
where the nodal mass, $m_{\mathit{ij}}^{\mathit{t}}$, is represented as
%
\begin{equation}
m_{\mathit{ij}}^{\mathit{t}} = \sum\limits_{\mathit{p=1}}^{N_{p}} 
\mathit{m}_{p} \mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}} (\mathbf{\mathit{x}}^{\mathit{t}}) 
\mathit{N}_{\mathit{j}} (\mathbf{\mathit{x}}^{\mathit{t}}) \,.
\end{equation}
%
The nodal internal force, $\mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{int,\mathit{t}}$ and the 
nodal external force, $\mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{ext,\mathit{t}}$ are defined as
%
\begin{align}
\nonumber
 \mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{int,\mathit{t}} & = - 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}}\mathit{m}_{p} \mathbf{G}_{ip}^{t} 
\cdot \sigma_{p}^{\mathit{s,t}} \,, \\ 
\mathbf{f}_{\mathit{i}}^{ext,\mathit{t}} & = - 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}}\mathit{m}_{p}  
\mathbf{b}_{p}^{\mathit{t}}\mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}}(\mathbf{x}_{p}^{\mathit{t}}) 
+ \sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{p}}\mathit{m}_{p} 
\mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}}(\mathbf{x}_{p}^{\mathit{t}}) 
\tau_{p}^{\mathit{s,t}}\mathit{h}^{-1} \,,
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{G}_{\mathit{ip}}^{\mathit{t}} = \Delta \mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}} 
(\mathbf{\mathit{x}})|_{\mathbf{\mathit{x}}=\mathbf{\mathit{X}}_{p}^{\mathit{t}}}$.
The nodal accelerations are obtained by explicit time integration 
of~\cref{eq:fmaMPM}. To obtain stable solutions, the time step used in the 
analysis should be less than the critical time step, which is defined as the 
ratio of the smallest cell size to the wave speed~\citep{Chen2002}. The 
critical time increment is obtained as
%
\begin{align}
\Delta t_{crit} = L / c \,, \\
c = \frac{K+\frac{4}{3}G}{\rho_s} \,,
\end{align}
where $L$ is the background cell size, \textit{c} is the pressure wave 
velocity, $K$ and $G$ are the bulk modulus and the shear modulus of the solid 
and $\rho_s$ is the density of the soil skeleton. The boundary conditions are 
enforced on the cell nodes, and the nodal velocities are obtained by solving 
the equation of motion at each node. The strain increment for each material 
point is determined using the gradients of the nodal basis functions. The 
corresponding stress increments are computed using the adopted constitutive 
law. After updating all the material points, the computational mesh is 
discarded, and a new mesh is defined for the next time step. 

\subsection{Boundary conditions}
The Material Point Method uses standard shape functions, similar to those used 
in the Finite Element Methods. Therefore the essential and the natural boundary 
conditions can be applied to the background grid nodes in the same way as in 
the traditional FEM. The free surface boundary conditions are satisfied, as the 
MPM is formulated in the weak form. Implementation of traction boundary 
conditions requires a set of material points to represent the boundary 
layer.~\citet{Bandara2013} proposed a friction interaction for the planar 
boundary condition using Coulomb's friction criterion. The friction boundary 
algorithm for the solid phase adopted in the present study is shown 
in~\cref{alg:friction}. The friction boundary conditions are applied on the 
mesh nodes by controlling the nodal acceleration tangential to the boundary. 
The nodal accelerations are considered to include the frictional effects 
instead of the forces, as the forces are proportional to the corresponding 
accelerations. Both static and kinetic friction are considered, and applied 
only when the particles are in contact with the boundary. The static and 
kinematic frictions are applied in the direction tangential to the nodal 
boundary. Friction forces are applied only if the particles are in contact. 
The normal velocity and acceleration on the boundary plane is zero. 
Displacement boundary conditions are applied as velocity constraints on the 
nodes in the background mesh.

\subsection{Integration scheme}

\citet{Love2006} investigated the energy consistency of MPM and observed that 
the MPM algorithm is better suited to flow calculations than the Lagrangian 
finite element method. The energy-consistent MPM formulation is effective 
in simulating materials that exhibit localised dissipative mechanisms. In 
dynamic MPM, an explicit time integration scheme is 
adopted to advance the solution.~\citet{Bardenhagen2002} studied the energy 
consistency of MPM using two different explicit integration schemes. The 
\textit{update stress first} (USF) scheme involves updating the strain and the 
stress at the beginning of the time step from the velocities of the previous 
time step. In the \textit{update stress last} (USL) approach, the updated 
particle momentums are used to calculate the nodal velocities, which are then 
used to update the particle strain and stress.~\citet{Bardenhagen2002} observed 
that the USL approach performed better 
than the USF. The USL approach dissipates the energy slowly, while the USF 
approach is found to gain energy~\citep{Kafaji2013}. The USL approach yields 
almost the same result as using the central difference scheme that is second 
order in time~\citep{Wallstedt2008}. The \textit{update stress last} approach 
is used in the present study due to its dissipative nature, which is useful in 
modelling granular flow problems and numerical stability.

In problems involving a slow rate of loading, i.e. quasi-static problems, the 
flow of the material is much slower than the speed of wave propagation in the 
material. Hence, employing an implicit time integration scheme reduces the 
computational time considerably~\citep{Kafaji2013}.~\citet{Guilkey2003a} 
proposed an implicit time integration method for MPM using quasi-static 
governing equations and the Newmark integration scheme.~\citet{Love2006} 
showed that implicit time integration in MPM is unconditionally stable. 
Although, MPM does not suffer from the limitations of FEM in simulating large 
deformations, more research is required for applying implicit time integration 
for large deformation problems. The present study focuses on large deformation 
problems, hence an explicit time integration scheme with the USL approach is 
adopted.

\subsection{Solution scheme}

In the present study a template-based three-dimensional C++11 Material Point 
Method code, developed at the University of Cambridge~\citep{Bandara2013}, is 
modified and extended to study granular flow problems. The three-dimensional 
MPM code is parallelised to run on multi-core systems, thus improving the 
computational efficiency. The algorithm of the MPM code is improved to handle 
multi-body dynamics and interactions. A step-by-step solution scheme for 
the Material Point Method implemented in the present study is described below:

\begin{itemize}

\item
A continuum body is discretised into a finite set of material points 
corresponding to the original configuration of the body. The number of material 
points corresponds to the resolution of the mesh size adopted in the Finite 
Element Method. The material points are followed throughout the deformation of 
the material, which is a Lagrangian description of the motion. 

\item
An arbitrary computational grid is initialised to describe the natural 
coordinates of the material points. For the purpose of simplicity, a Cartesian 
grid is usually adopted. 

\item
The state variables (mass/density, velocity, strain, stress, other material 
parameters corresponding to the adopted constitutive relation) are initialised 
at every material point. 

\item
The shape function $N_{ip}^t(x_p)$ and the gradient of the shape function 
$G_{ip}^t$ for each material point are computed.

\item
The information and properties carried by each material point are projected 
onto the background mesh using the shape functions computed from the 
particle position. 

\item
The nodal mass matrix is obtained as
%
\begin{equation}
\mathit{m}_{\mathit{i}}^{\mathit{t}} = 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{\mathit{p}}} \mathit{m}_{\mathit{p}} 
\mathit{N}_{\mathit{ip}}^{\mathit{t}}(x^t_p) \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathit{m}_{i}^{t}$ is the mass at node \textit{i} at time \textit{t}, 
$\mathit{m}_{\mathit{p}}$ is the particle mass, $\mathit{N}_{\mathit{i}}$ is 
the shape function associated with node \textit{i}, and 
$\mathit{x}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}}$ is the location of the particle at time
\textit{t}.
% The numerical solution of the momentum balance equation is obtained 
%at a discrete set of times $t^k$, where \textit{k} = 1,\dots,\textit{K}. A 
%discrete approximation 
%at time $t^k$ is indicated by a superscript \textit{k}.

\item
The nodal velocity is obtained by mapping the particle velocity onto the nodes 
using the shape functions. If necessary, the boundary conditions
for the nodal velocities are applied.
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}^{\mathit{t}} = 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{p}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{\mathit{p}}} \mathit{m}_{\mathit{p}} 
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{N}}_{\mathit{ip}}^{\mathit{t}} (x^t_p) / 
\mathit{m}_{\mathit{i}}^{\mathit{t}} \,.
\end{equation}

\item
The momentum balance equation for the solid phase is solved, and the nodal 
acceleration is computed as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathit{a}}_i^t = \frac{1}{m_i^t} \left( - \sum\limits_{p = 
1}^{N_p}{G}_{ip}^t \sigma_p^t \Omega_p^t + \sum\limits_{p = 
1}^{N_p}m_p^t \mathbf{b}_p^t N_{ip}^t(x^t_p)  \right) \,.
\end{equation}
If necessary, the boundary conditions for the nodal accelerations are applied.


\item
The nodal velocity at the end of the Lagrangian time step (L) is obtained from 
the computed nodal acceleration as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathit{v}}_{\mathit{i}}^{L} = 
\mathit{\mathbf{v}}_{\mathit{i}}^{\mathit{t}} + 
\mathbf{\mathit{a}}_{\mathit{i}}^{\mathit{t}} \Delta \mathit{t} \,.
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t = (t+1) - t$.

\item
The particle position and its velocity are updated according to
\begin{align}
\nonumber
\mathbf{x}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}+1} &  = 
\mathbf{x}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}} + 
\Delta \mathit{t} \sum\limits_{\mathit{i}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{v}}_{\mathit{i}}^{L}\mathit{N}_{\mathit{ip}}^{\mathit{t}} \,, \\
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}+1} & = \mathbf{v}_{\mathit{p}}^{\mathit{t}} 
+ 
\Delta \mathit{t} \sum\limits_{\mathit{i}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}} 
\mathbf{\mathit{a}}_{\mathit{i}}^{t}\mathit{N}_{\mathit{ip}}^{\mathit{t}} \,.
\end{align}


\item
The strain increment $\Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1}$ for the particle is then 
computed as
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1} = \frac{\Delta t}{2} 
\sum\limits_{\mathit{i}=1}^{\mathit{N}_{n}}{{G}_{\mathit{ip}}^{t} 
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}^{t} + ({G}_{\mathit{ip}}^{t} 
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}^{t})^{\mathit{T}}} \,.
\end{equation}
\item
The stress increment for the particle $\Delta \sigma_{\mathit{p}}^{t+1}$ is 
computed from the strain increment using the constitutive model adopted in the 
simulation
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta \sigma_{\mathit{p}}^{t+1} = \mathbf{D} : \Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1} \,.
\end{equation}
%
In large deformation problems, the Jaumann rate is used to update the effective 
stress of the solid particles
\begin{align}
\sigma_p^{t+1} & = \Delta t \left( \sigma_p^t - \mathbf{W}_p^t - 
\mathbf{W}_p^t \sigma_p^t\right) x+ 
\mathbf{D} : \Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1} \,, \\
\mathbf{W}_p^t & = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N_n}\left[ \mathbf{G}_{ip}^t 
\textbf{v}_i^t -  \left(\mathbf{G}_{ip}^t \textbf{v}_i^t\right)^T\right]  \,.
\end{align}
\item
The stress and the strain of the material points are updated based on
%
\begin{align}
\nonumber
\sigma_{\mathit{p}}^{t+1} & = \sigma_{\mathit{p}}^{t} + \Delta 
\sigma_{\mathit{p}}^{t+1} \,, \\
\epsilon_{p}^{t+1} & =\epsilon_{p}^{t} + \Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1} \,.
\end{align}
%

\item
In large deformations, the volume of the solid material points $\Omega_p$ is 
updated using the determinant \textit{J} of the deformation gradient 
$\mathbf{F}_p^{t+1}$
\begin{equation}
\Omega_p^{t+1} = J \Omega_p^{t_0} \,.
\end{equation}

\item
The material point density is then updated as
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{p}^{t+1}=\frac{\rho_{p}^{t}}{\{1+tr(\Delta \epsilon_{p}^{t+1})\}} \,.
\end{equation}
%

\item
At the end of every time step, all the variables on the grid nodes are 
initialised to zero. The material points carry all the information about the
solution, and the computational grid is re-initialised for the next step.
\end{itemize}
\Cref{fig:MPMsteps} illustrates the steps involved in a MPM analysis.

\subsubsection{Post-processing}

The post-processing stage, as in most analysis, involves visualization 
and extraction of the data from the analysis. In mesh-less methods, like MPM, 
structures are generally represented as points which 
describe a discrete region of the body. MPM facilitates representation of 
arbitrarily complex geometries and has advantages over strictly grid-based 
methods, especially in simulations involving large 
deformations~\citep{Bardenhagen2000}. However, MPM poses a whole new set of 
visualization problems. It is essential to visualise the general configuration 
of the body as well as observe the finer details like the development of cracks 
or separation of chunks of material from the body. The body is discretised into 
conceptual material points, which carry all the relevant information of the 
corresponding segment. The unique qualities of MPM necessitate the need to 
visualise the particle data in a way that is informative and appropriate.

In MPM, the particle data represent the finite portion of a larger 
continuum, and the ability to see and interpret the 
macroscopic structure created by these particles is vital~\citep{bigler2006}. 
There are two main aspects in visualizing MPM data: (1) visualization of 
the structure represented by the material points and (2) understanding the 
qualitative trends associated with the material points like mass, velocity or 
stress.

The MPM output data contain both the material point and the grid data, and
one approach in visualizing MPM data is to render the interpolated 
particle values on grid nodes using the 
\textit{iso-surfacing}~\citep{lorensen1987} 
or \textit{volume rendering}~\citep{levoy1988}. In regions where the 
material points are sparse, it is necessary that the grid resolution is 
sufficiently fine to compensate for the missing features. This results in 
storing a large amount of unnecessary data in regions where sufficient material 
points are present. Thus, it is advantageous to visualise MPM data of the 
material points as particles~\citep{bigler2006}. Particle visualization 
involves rendering the particles as a spheres or an ellipsoids representing the 
size and location of the fraction of the 
continuum~\citep{kuester2001,krogh1997,gumhold2003}. In the present study, MPM 
data points are represented as spheres.  Colour mapping of scalar 
quantities, such as mass, velocity, or stress, of a material point are applied 
to provide additional qualitative understanding of the data.


\subsection{GIMP method}

The shape functions used in MPM are continuous, and hence penetrations between 
bodies are handled automatically without the need for any supplemental contact 
algorithm~\citep{Chen2002}. In MPM, the continuum body deforms and moves in 
an arbitrary computation grid. All boundary conditions are carried by 
the boundary particles. If a boundary particle is present in a cell, then the 
cell boundary becomes a part of the continuum body, and the cell size 
represents the thickness of the boundary. In certain cases, however, both the 
boundary particle and an interior particle can be found in a cell. In such 
cases, the cell is still treated as a boundary cell, and the interior particle 
temporarily acts as a boundary particle. To avoid numerical errors, it is 
essential to use a smaller cell size along the boundary~\citep{Chen2002}. 

In MPM simulations, numerical noise is observed when material points 
cross the cell boundaries as the body deforms. The noise is termed \textit{cell 
crossing noise}. If a material point is located very close to 
the cell boundary. Then the results is a discontinuous gradient of the weighing 
function causing a force imbalance on the grid~\citep{Bardenhagen2004}. This 
results in large, non-physical acceleration values causing separation of 
material points from the continuum~\citep{Sulsky1995}. 
~\Cref{fig:cellnoise} illustrates the problem of cell crossing noise. The 
main reason for the occurrence of cell crossing noise is the use of piecewise 
linear shape functions. However, this problem, which is predominant when using 
fine mesh size, can be overcome by changing the order of arithmetic operation, 
as proposed by \citet{Sulsky1995}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{cellnoise}
\caption{Schematic description of the occurrence of cell crossing noise in MPM.}
\label{fig:cellnoise}
\end{figure}

To overcome the problem of cell crossing 
noise, \citet{Bardenhagen2004} proposed an alternate method called the 
Generalised Interpolation Material Point Method that uses smoother shape 
functions and a larger influence region for each grid node. This approach 
minimises the cell crossing noise. The piecewise-linear grid basis functions 
used are written as
%
\begin{align}
\bar{\phi}(x) = \begin{cases}
1-\left|x\right|/h \qquad &: \qquad \left|x\right| < h \\
0 \qquad &: \qquad otherwise \,,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where \textit{h} is the grid spacing. The basis function associated with grid 
node \textit{i} at position $x_i$ is then $\bar{\phi}_i=\bar{\phi}(x - x_i)$. 
The basis 
functions in 3-D are separable functions constructed as $\bar{\phi}_i(x) = 
\bar{\phi}_i^x(x)
\bar{\phi}_i^y(y)\bar{\phi}_i^z(z)$. GIMP is often implemented using the 
standard 
piecewise-linear grid basis functions and piecewise-constant particle 
characteristic functions:
\begin{align}
\chi_p = \begin{cases}
1 \qquad &: \qquad \left|x\right| < \frac{1}{2}l_p \\
0 \qquad &: \qquad otherwise \,,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
%
in which case the 1-D MPM and GIMP weighting functions can be grouped together 
in the general form
%
\begin{align}
\bar{\phi} = \begin{cases}
1 - (4x^2+l_p^2)/(4hl_p)\qquad &: \qquad \left|x\right| < \frac{l_p}{2} \\
1 - \left|x\right|/h \qquad &: \qquad \frac{l_p}{2} \le \left|x\right| < h - 
\frac{l_p}{2} \\
\left(h +\frac{l_p}{2} - \left|x\right| \right)^2/(2hl_p) \qquad &: \qquad h - 
\frac{l_p}{2} \le \left|x\right| < h +
\frac{l_p}{2} \\
0 \qquad &: \qquad otherwise \,,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
%
\nomenclature[g-chi]{$\chi$}{Characteristic function}
\nomenclature[g-psibar]{$\bar{\phi}$}{Weighting function}
where $l_p$ is the width of the particle characteristic function 
$\chi_p$.~\Cref{fig:gimp} shows a 1-D GIMP weighting function $\bar{\phi}_{ip}$ 
and gradient weighting function $\bar{\nabla\phi}_{ip}$ for a 
piecewise-constant $\chi_p$ with a characteristic length of \textit{l}. The 
GIMP weighting function is smooth; however, a discontinuity is observed in the 
gradient weighting function. 


In traditional MPM, boundary conditions need only be applied on those nodes 
which coincide with the extent of the computational domain. As  illustrated 
in~\cref{fig:MPM_Linear} nodes beyond those boundaries are not influenced by 
particles within the domain, which can be considered a result of the zero
width of the Dirac delta characteristic functions. However, special attention 
is required to simulate the boundaries in the Generalised Interpolation 
Material Point Method (GIMP). Namely, because of their increased extents, it is 
possible for particles to influence, and be influenced by, nodes that lie 
outside of the simulation domain (\cref{fig:GIMP_function}). These extra nodes 
are referred to as the ``ghost'' nodes. Boundary condition treatment of these 
nodes for Dirichlet conditions is the same as for the regular boundary
nodes, namely, their computed values are replaced by prescribed 
values~\citep{Steffen2008}.

In the present study, the influence of the GIMP method on the run-out behaviour 
of a granular column collapse experiment is investigated.~\Cref{fig:exp} shows 
a granular column of height $H_0$, and length $L_0$, is allowed to collapse 
and flow on a horizontal plane. The run-out distance observed is proportional 
to 
the initial aspect ratio of the column ($H_0/L_0$). A granular column with an 
initial aspect ratio of 0.4 is considered for the comparison. The granular 
column is represented by 32,000 material points arranged uniformly on a regular 
lattice with a particle spacing of 0.25~\si{\mm}. Since the scale of the 
problem being modelled is small and it is important to precisely define the 
flow surface, a larger number of material points are used to represent the 
geometry. When modelling geophysical problems, where the tolerance in 
defining the flow surface is in the order of a few millimetres, however, each 
material point shall represent individual grains or orders of magnitude larger 
than the grain size. A grid size of 1~\si{mm} is adopted with 16 material 
points per cell. In order to understand the influence of the number of material 
points on the accuracy of the solution, a simulation using 4 material points 
per cell with GIMP is also performed. The granular collapse experiment is 
performed for a column with an initial aspect ratio of 0.4 using both GIMP 
method and MPM with 16 material points per cell. 

The evolution of run-out at time $t=\tau_c$ and $t=6\tau_c$, where $\tau_c$ is 
the critical time when the potential energy is fully mobilised, is presented 
in~\cref{fig:MPM_GIMP_TC}. At the initial stage of collapse $t=\tau_c$, both 
MPM and GIMP give almost the same behaviour. The run-out observed in the case 
of 4 material points per cell is similar to the run-out behaviour for 16 
material points per cell. At the end of the flow, the GIMP simulation with 4 
material points shows oscillations at the flow front due to fewer material 
points in the cell. However, both MPM and GIMP show a smoother response at 
the flow front. The evolution of run-out and height with time for both MPM and 
GIMP are presented in~\cref{fig:MPM_GIMP}. For a time up to $t=1.5\tau_c$ all 
approaches yield the exact same behaviour. However, as the flow progresses, the 
number of material points per cell at the flow front decreases, resulting in 
oscillations. The oscillations decrease with increase in the number of 
material points. Hence, it is 
essential to have a larger number of material points, especially at the flow 
front. The difference in the normalised run-out between the MPM and GIMP 
methods is 
about 2.5\%. This is due to the difference in the interpolation scheme adopted 
in both approaches. GIMP method offers a better approximation of the run-out 
behaviour as a result of the continuous basis function. This also results in a 
smoother stress and velocity distribution in GIMP than MPM. With increase in 
the number of material points and the use of finer mesh size decreases the 
difference between both approaches. The computational effort using GIMP method 
is almost twice that of MPM, since GIMP method considers the particles at 
neighbouring cells due to the larger spread of the basis functions. In the 
present study, a very fine mesh and 16 material points per cell are used to 
simulate large deformation problems.

\subsection{Application of MPM in geomechanics}

The studies on using MPM in modelling geotechnical problems are limited. The 
potential of the Material Point Method 
in modelling granular flows, due to the discharge of silos, was first 
recognised by~\citet{Wieckowski1999}.~\citet{Bardenhagen2001} developed a 
frictional contact algorithm to model granular materials. The Mohr-Coloumb 
model criterion is used to describe the kinematics of the grains. In this 
model, a contact is defined when the nodal velocity interpolated from all 
material points in the cell differs from the nodal velocity interpolated from a 
single material point.~\citet{Coetzee2005} applied this contact algorithm to 
understand the pull-out behaviour of anchors.~\citet{Ma2014} developed a new 
contact algorithm with a penalty contact function and a limited maximum shear 
stress for soil-structure interaction, i.e. interaction of pipe-line with 
debris flow or submarine landslide. The penalty contact function behaves 
similarly to numerical damping and thus reduces the oscillations during the 
impact. 

\citet{Beuth2010} applied Gaussian integration in quasi-static MPM to model 
large strain problems. In this approach, however, the conservation of mass is 
not valid as a larger filled volume of material is 
considered.~\citet{Andersen2010} used the GIMP method with an elasto-plastic 
model to simulate slope failures. The solution is found to be dependant on the 
number of material points used to 
describe the slope geometry.~\citet{Mast2014} studied the behaviour of granular 
column collapse using a non-associative flow rule. They observed a 
significant increase in the run-out distance for large aspect ratio 
columns.~\citet{Mast2014a} investigated the suitability of the MPM in 
prediction of large deformation problems, such as snow avalanches. 

\citet{Guilkey2007} developed a coupled numerical scheme for fluid-structure 
interactions. The solid field is modelled in a Lagrangian frame, while an 
Eulerian frame, compressible CFD, is used for the fluid. As the MPM computation 
grid is reset at every stage, the same Eulerian grid is adopted for both the 
solid and the fluid. A similar approach was adopted by~\cite{Zhang2008} to 
model multiphase flows, where the interactions between the solid and gas are 
modelled using the MPM background mesh as an Eulerian 
grid.~\citet{Mackenzie-Helnwein2010} investigated various techniques to model 
multiphase drag forces. Both solid and fluid are modelled as Lagrangian 
particles using the mixture theory.~\citet{Abe2013} developed a soil–pore fluid 
coupled MPM algorithm based on Biot’s mixture theory for solving 
hydro-mechanical interaction problems.~\citet{Bandara2013} developed a unique 
approach in modelling solid-fluid interactions. Two sets of Lagrangian 
particles are used to represent soil skeleton and pore water, 
separately.~\citet{Bandara2013} applied the coupled MPM to solve large 
deformation problems such as slope failure due to seepage.

In the present study, the Material Point Method is used to model large 
deformation problems, such as collapse of dry columns and soil slopes subjected 
to horizontal excitation. The suitability of the continuum approach (MPM) in 
modelling large deformation problems is also investigated.

\section{Particulate modelling of granular flows}

Granular materials often exhibit different behaviours under different 
circumstances. Fluidised granular material often resembles a liquid and 
reveals surface waves. In certain situations, granular materials behave more 
like solids exhibiting plastic deformations. Despite the wide variation in 
the physical and the chemical properties of the grains, the discrete granular 
structure has a rich generic phenomenology, motivating researchers to 
understand the fundamental behaviour of these materials. 

A granular material can be 
considered as a continuous material if it is viewed at a macroscopic scale, 
ignoring the fact that it is composed of grains. On a macroscopic scale, the 
behaviour of the granular material can be approximately defined using 
continuum mechanics. However, on a grain level, granular materials 
exhibit complex solid-like and/or fluid-like behaviours depending on the way 
the grains interact with each other. Analytical and finite element models, 
which consider granular materials as a continuum, cannot take into account the 
local geometrical processes that govern the mechanical behaviour of a 
non-homogeneous soil. The application of continuum models to describe granular 
flow poses subtle problems for statistical analysis~\citep{Mehta1994}. 
The grain-level description of the granular material enriches the macro-scale 
variables, which poorly account for the local rheology of the materials. 

Numerical models, such as the Discrete Element approach proposed 
by~\citet{Cundall1979a}, are capable of simulating the granular material as a 
discontinuous system. Although modern measurement techniques can probe local 
granular variables, like grain position, velocities, contact 
forces, they have inherent limitations in acquiring those variables. The 
\textit{discrete-element} approach is a powerful and reliable research tool 
to study the behaviour of granular materials at the grain-scale. This approach 
involves applying Newton's equation of motion simultaneously to all grains 
described as rigid solid bodies by considering the contact forces and the 
external forces acting on the grains. For a given boundary condition, the 
collective mechanical response of grains to the external force leads to 
relative motion between grains constrained in a dense state, and by 
inelastic collisions in the loose state.~\citet{Cundall1979a} applied this 
method to granular geomaterials, and terming it the \textit{Distinct Element 
Method}, to differentiate it from the existing \textit{Finite Element Method} 
used in geomechanics. The attribute ``distinct'' refers to the degrees of 
freedom of individual grains, but it was later replaced by ``discrete'' to 
underline the discrete nature of the system. 

The interactions between the individual grains are governed by unilateral 
contact laws, and the mechanism of energy dissipation is through friction and 
inelastic collisions. Moreover, granular materials have a wide variation in 
their grain shape and size distribution that require appropriate numerical 
treatments. In DEM, the normal reaction force, 
which prevents the interpenetration of two grains, is proportional to the depth 
of penetration. Thus, frictional contact between grains can be expressed 
as a function of the configuration variables, which describe the positions and 
velocities of the grains~\citep{Radjai2011}.

Discrete-Element methods, which describe interactions between grains based on 
the explicit overlap between the grains, are termed as \textit{smooth methods}. 
Another approach is the \textit{non-smooth approach}~\citep{Jean1999}, which 
describes the behaviour of discrete elements using the main features of 
uni-laterality and Coulomb friction, and neglect the finer details such 
as interpenetration and overlap between grains. The fundamental difference 
between the non-smooth method and the common discrete element method 
lies in the treatment of small length and time scales involved 
in the dynamics of granular media. In DEM, the grains are treated 
as rigid bodies, but the contacts between grains are assumed to obey the 
visco-elastic constitutive law. The time-stepping schemes used for the 
numerical integration of the equations of motion in DEM imply that the contact 
interactions involve smaller time and length scales. In 
the non-smooth Contact Dynamics (CD) method, these small scales are neglected 
and their effects are absorbed into the contact laws. In non-smooth 
formulation, the grain dynamics are described at a larger scale than the 
elastic response time and displacement scales~\citep{Jean1999, Radjai2009}. 

DEM simulations can easily capture the complex flow mechanics of 
large-deformation problems than the continuum approach.~\cite{Tang2009} used 2D 
discrete element modelling to understand the mechanism of the Tsaoling 
landslide triggered by the Chi-Chi earthquake. The researchers were able to 
establish the landslide has a low-friction coefficient 
(about 0.15) and a medium strength. They were also able to back-calculate a 
maximum velocity of sliding reached 50~\si{\m\per\s}. 
Similarly,~\cite{Tang2013} performed 3D discrete-element simulations to 
understand the 
transportation and deposition of the 2009 Hsiaolin landslide. The authors 
estimated the friction coefficient of landslide-mass to have reached a critical 
value of 0.1, at which the mass begins to slide and reach a maximum velocity of 
40 - 50~\si{\m\per\s}. Two-dimensional DEM simulations have been used to 
analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of slope failure and landslides from 
the intact, pre-failure slope to the restabilised, post-failure slope composed 
of bonded material~\citep{Katz2014}. The pre-failure slope material 
disintegration is found to be the fundamental element in determining the size 
and geometry of the resultant landslides.~\citet{Liu2013} studied the 
kinematics and internal deformation of granular slopes which experience 
flow-like behaviour. They observed that dilatant grain-shearing flow is 
the dominating mechanism in the movement of granular slopes. DEM is capable of 
probing the material response in a detailed scale, where conventional 
experiments or field tests are not feasible. Hence, in the present study, 2D 
discrete element simulations are performed to understand the behaviour of 
granular flows.~\citet{Rickenmann2006} applied 2D debris-flow simulation models 
to two well-documented field events. Two-dimensional simulations provided 
reasonable results for the extent of the deposits and the relative 
spatial distribution of deposit thicknesses. Nevertheless, some general 
characteristics of debris flow deposits, which are necessary for hazard 
assessment, may be reasonably well-simulated with these simple modelling 
approaches if rheologic or friction parameters can be measured or calibrated.

\section{Discrete Element Method}

The Discrete Element Method (DEM) computes the equilibrium and the trajectories 
of a classical multi-body system. DEM is a simple and 
flexible discrete-element approach, which involves applying Newton's second law 
of motion to each grain to describe the deformation of the granular assembly 
% 
\begin{equation} 
{m}_{i}\frac{{{d}^{2}}{{x}_{i}}}{d{{t}^{2}}} = {{\mathbf{F}}_{i}}, 
(i=1,...,N ) \,,
\label{eq:fma}
\end{equation}
%
where \textit{N} is the number of grains in the simulation, $m_{\mathit{i}}$ 
is the mass of a grain \textit{i}, $x_{\mathit{i}}$ is its position, and 
$\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{i}}$ is the force exerted on a grain. The method consists 
of 
calculating the forces $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{i}}$ and then solving 
the ordinary differential in~\cref{eq:fma}. In general, the system of coupled 
non-linear differential equations cannot be solved analytically. The 
approximate numerical solution of these equations, which describes the 
trajectories of all the grains of the system is called the Discrete Element 
Method.

DEM simulations are similar to the real experiments, involving the generation 
of samples (initial conditions) with \textit{N} grains and solving the Newton's 
equation of motion for the system until the properties of the system no longer 
change with time (equilibration of the system). The computation of the forces 
and torques is the central part of the Discrete Element Method simulation. The 
dynamics of the granular material is governed by Newton's equation of motion 
which depends on the centre-of-mass coordinates and 
the Euler angles of the grains \textit{i} ($i = 1, 2 \cdots , N$):
%
\begin{align} 
\frac{{{\partial}^2}{\overrightarrow{r_i}}}{\partial{t^2}} 
&=\frac{1}{m_i}\overrightarrow{{\mathbf{F}}_{i}}(\overrightarrow{r_j},\overrightarrow{v_j},
 \overrightarrow{\varphi_j},\overrightarrow{\omega_j}) \,, \\ 
\frac{{\partial^2}{\overrightarrow{\varphi_i}}}{\partial{t^2}}&
=\frac{1}{{\hat{J}}_i}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_i}
(\overrightarrow{r_j},\overrightarrow{v_j},\overrightarrow{\varphi_j},
   \overrightarrow{\omega_j}), (j=1,...,N) \,.
\end{align}
%
The force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}_{i}}$ and the torque 
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_{i}}$, which act on a grain \textit{i} of mass 
$\mathit{m}_{\mathit{i}}$ and the tensorial moment of inertia 
${\hat{J}_i}$ are functions of the grain 
positions $\overrightarrow{\mathit{r}_{\mathit{j}}}$, their angular 
orientations $\overrightarrow{\varphi}_{\mathit{j}}$, and their corresponding 
velocities $\overrightarrow{\mathit{v}_{\mathit{j}}}$ and 
$\overrightarrow{\omega}_{\mathit{j}}$. In a two-dimensional system, the 
angular orientation of a grain is described by a single (scalar) quantity 
$\varphi_{i}$ and the moment of inertia reduces to a scalar value 
$\mathit{J}_{i}$. 
\nomenclature[g-phivar]{$\varphi$}{Angular orientation of a grain}
\nomenclature[g-omega]{$\omega$}{Angular velocity of a grain (or) Local contact 
natural frequency}
\nomenclature[g-gamma]{$\gamma$}{Viscous damping of a grain}
\nomenclature[a-r]{\textit{r}}{Radius or hydrodynamic radius of a grain in LBM}

\nomenclature[s-min]{\textit{min}}{Minimum}
\nomenclature[g-eta]{$\eta_h$}{Packing density, defined as the ratio of volume 
of solids to the total volume ($V_s /V$)}

%The Newton's equation of motion can be written as
%%
%\begin{align} 
%	\frac{{{\partial}^2}{\overrightarrow{r_i}}}{\partial{t^2}} 
%	
%&=\frac{1}{m_i}\overrightarrow{{\mathbf{F}}_{i}}(\overrightarrow{r_j},\overrightarrow{v_j},
%	\overrightarrow{\varphi_j},\overrightarrow{\omega_j})
%	\nonumber \\ 
%	
%\frac{{\partial^2}{\overrightarrow{\varphi_i}}}{\partial{t^2}}&=\frac{1}{{\hat{J}}_i}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_i}(\overrightarrow{r_j},\overrightarrow{v_j},\overrightarrow{\varphi_j},
%	\overrightarrow{\omega_j}), (j=1,...,N) \,. \nonumber
%\end{align}

For grains in the absence of long range fields, the force  
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}_{i}}$ and the torque  
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_{i}}$ acting upon the grain \textit{i} are given as 
a sum of the pairwise interaction of a grain \textit{i} with 
all other grains in the system:
%
\begin{align}
   \overrightarrow{{\mathbf{F}}_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1,j\ne 
   i}^{N}{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}_{ij}}}, \qquad 
   &\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_{i}}=\sum\limits_{j=1,j\ne 
   i}^{N}{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{M}_{ij}}} \,.
\end{align}
%
The limitation to pairwise interaction is an abstraction, which is justified 
if the grain deformation at the contact is trivial. To describe the 
deformation of granular assemblies one has to take into account the effect of 
multi-grain interactions. This generalised method can be applied to a wide 
range of systems. The Discrete Element Method can be used to study the 
behaviour of grains in rapid flows and in static assemblies. The method treats 
both conditions in exactly the same way; it is not necessary to divide the 
system and then treat each condition differently. The simplest model for 
a grain is a sphere. In a two-dimensional case, the sphere is reduced to 
a circular disk. Simulations using spherical grains are numerically very 
effective, since grain collisions can be easily identified and described in 
a simplistic way~\citep{Poschel2005}.

In the present study, a two-dimensional DEM code is developed in C++ 
to study the micro-scale rheology of dry granular flows. Existing DEM codes do 
not yet fully support micro-scale fluid solid coupling using the Lattice 
Boltzmann approach, which will be used to study the mechanism of submarine 
landslides. A new C++ based high performance DEM code is developed in the 
present study. The features implemented in the present study, and the general 
overview of DEM are discussed below.

%%******************************************************************************

\subsection{The Forces}

The force $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{i}}$ in~\cref{eq:fma} represents both the grain 
to grain interaction force and other external forces acting on the system. 
Therefore, the force $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{i}}$ is expressed as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f}
 \mathbf{{F}}_{i}=\sum\limits_{j\ne 1}{\mathbf{{F}}_{ij}+\mathbf{{F}}_{ext, 
 i}}\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{i}}$ is the force exerted by a grain \textit{j} on 
\textit{i}. The external force $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{ext,i}}$ is most often the 
force of gravity, $\mathbf{F}_{\mathit{ext,i}} = m_{\mathit{i}} \mbox{ 
}\mathbf{g}_{\mathit{i}}$. The methodology to incorporate any other external 
forces in the simulation is the same. However, the computation of the 
interaction forces depends on the numerical method adopted in the study. 
The methodology used in the present study is described below. 

Consider two grains \textit{i} and \textit{j} in contact 
(\cref{fig:DEM}). The contact force can be decomposed into two components, 
as the normal ($\mathit{F}_{n}$) and the tangential ($\mathit{F}_{t}$) 
components
%
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{F}_{ij}=F_{n}\mathbf{n}+F_{t}\mathbf{t} \,.
\label{eq:fnt}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{DEM}
	\caption[Calculation of normal force in DEM.]{Grains \textit{i} and 
	\textit{j} in

\end{figure}

where \textbf{n} and \textbf{t} are unit vectors, pointing in the normal and 
the tangential directions. The procedure adopted to calculate the normal and 
tangential forces is discussed in the following subsections.
\clearpage
%****************************************** %
\subsubsection*{Normal force}
When grains collide, part of the kinetic energy is dissipated as 
heat and the other part causes deformation of the grain. These deformations 
generate interaction forces. In DEM, the grains are considered to be rigid 
while their contact is assumed to be soft. Thus, the grains do not change their 
shape; instead they overlap. The shapes of the grains are conserved on average, 
after many collisions. The overlap at the contact is limited to very small 
deformations, which are achieved by defining a repulsive normal force that 
opposes the overlap. The mutual compression ($\delta_{n}$) of the grains 
\textit{i} and \textit{j} is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
 \delta_{n}=\left|x_{\mathbf{i}}-x_{\mathit{j}}\right|-r_{i}-r_{j} \,,
\label{eq:delta}
\end{equation}
%
where $x_{\mathit{i}}$ and $x_{\mathit{j}}$ are vectors fixing the centres of 
the grains, and 
$r_{\mathit{i}}$ and $r_{\mathit{j}}$ are their radii (\cref{fig:DEM}). When 
$\delta_{n}>0$, the two grains are not in contact, and 
there is no interaction. When $\delta_{n}<0$, the two grains overlap, and 
there is a repulsive normal force that pushes the two grains apart. As a 
simple model, consider the contact as a linear spring with damping. The 
repulsive force depends linearly on $\delta_{n}$ and is controlled by the 
stiffness of the grain. The energy dissipation due to the interaction between 
grains is an intrinsic characteristic of the granular material and is 
incorporated by adding a damping force that opposes the relative velocity for 
the duration of the contact. The interaction force at the contact is idealised 
as a simple spring-dashpot system, with elastic and dissipative 
constants~\citep{Luding1994}. 
%
\begin{align}
 {{F}_{n}}=
\begin{cases}
0, & {{\delta}_{n}}>0 \\
-{{k}_{n}}{{\delta}_{n}}-{{\gamma}_{n}}\frac{d{{\delta}_{n}}}{dt}, & 
{{\delta}_{n}}<0 \\
\end{cases}
\end{align} 
%
The constant ${k}_{n}$ characterises the stiffness of the grain and must be 
chosen to be sufficiently large so that the overlap between the grains remains 
small. Nevertheless, the solution has an undesirable property of generating an 
attractive force~\citep{Poschel2005}. It arises just before the two grains 
separate. In this case, we have ${d{\delta_{n}}}$$/{dt} > 0$ while $\delta_{n}$ 
approaches zero. To avoid the attractive force, the force is computed in two 
stages: a candidate force $\hat{F}_{n}$ is calculated and verified as to 
whether it is non-negative
%
\begin{align}
 {\hat{F}_{n}}=-{{k}_{n}}{{\delta}_{n}}-{{\gamma}_{n}}\frac{d{{\delta}_{n}}}{dt},
  \quad F_{n}=
\begin{cases}
0, & {\hat{F}} \le 0 \\
{\hat{F}}_{n}, & {\hat{F}} > 0 \\
\end{cases} \label{eq:nf}
\end{align} 
%
For pairwise collisions, the normal force $(F_{n})$, represented as, 
${{k}_{n}}{{\delta}_{n}}+{{\gamma}_{n}}$ causes a decrease in the relative 
normal velocity of the grains by a factor $\varepsilon$. This factor is the 
\textit{coefficient of restitution} and is defined as $\varepsilon\approx 
u^\prime/u$, 
where $u$ is the absolute normal relative velocity before 
the collision and $u^\prime$ corresponds to the post-collision value. The 
relative velocity, ${d{\delta_{n}}}$$/{dt} > 0$, can be obtained by 
differentiating~\cref{eq:delta}. Thus, we obtain
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vn}
\frac{d{\delta_{n}}}{dt}=(\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}-\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}).{\mathbf{n}}\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}=dx_{\mathit{i}}/dt$ is the velocity of the grain 
\textit{i} and $\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{j}}=dx_{\mathit{i}}/dt$ is the velocity of 
the grain \textit{j}. The numerical integration of~\cref{eq:vn} yields the 
separation $\delta_{n}$ and permits us to generalise the model so as to 
incorporate the tangential forces. By integrating 
Newton's equation of motion, it is found that the linear force corresponds to 
the co-efficient of restitution, which is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=exp(-\frac{\pi\gamma_{n}}{2m^{eff}}/\sqrt{\frac{Y}{m^{eff}}
-{\frac{\gamma^{n}}{2m^{eff}}}^{2}})\,.
\end{equation}
% 
%%*************************************************************************************************************************************************
% %

\subsubsection*{Tangential force}
Grains are not perfect spheres, they have a complicated surface 
texture. Therefore, at oblique collisions, there is a 
tangential force in addition to a normal force. Even perfectly smooth spheres 
exert a tangential force 
due to their bulk viscosity~\citep{Poschel2005}. To build a heap of 
spheres on a flat surface, the grains as well as the surface have to be 
sufficiently rough, indicating the dependency of the tangential force on the 
surface properties of the granular materials. For realistic simulations of 
granular materials, it is important to consider the tangential force in 
DEM. The tangential force is considered in a similar 
fashion to the normal force, arising from a spring stretched by the relative 
motion of the grain. Tangential forces are modelled by considering the relevant 
relative tangential velocity of the grain surfaces at the point of contact. The 
point of contact is an approximation, as the description of the normal force 
assumes a compression $\delta_{n}$, which implies a contact surface in 3-D or a 
contact line in 2-D. Assuming a tangential spring of length $\delta_{t}$ that 
exerts an opposing force to the relative tangential displacements (ignoring the 
effect 
of relative rolling between the grains), the tangential force can be postulated 
similar to the normal force (\cref{eq:vn}) as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vt}
\frac{d{\delta_{t}}}{dt}=(\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}-\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}})\times{\mathbf{t}}
 \,.
\end{equation}
%
As with~\cref{eq:fma}, this equation must also be numerically integrated. The 
grains are in contact when $\delta_{t}<0$, whereas when $\delta_{t}=0$, the 
grains no longer exert a force on each other. With these assumptions, 
$\delta_{t}$ can be calculated similar to the normal force. The tangential 
force is assumed to be governed by Coulomb's friction law:
%
\begin{equation}
\left|F_{\mathit{t}}\right|\le\mu F_{\mathit{n}} \,, \label{eq:fric}
\end{equation}
%
where $F_{\mathit{t}}$ is the tangential force and $\mu$ is the friction 
coefficient. It is therefore necessary to constrain the tangential force to 
remain less than or equal to $\mu F_{N}$. To impose the condition 
in~\cref{eq:fric}, two stages similar to the normal force computation are
adopted. The first step is to evaluate the candidate force, and the force is 
then accepted if it obeys the condition in~\cref{eq:fric}.
%
\begin{align}
 {\hat{F}_{t}}=-{{k}_{t}}{{\delta}_{t}}-{{\gamma}_{t}}\frac{d{{\delta}_{t}}}{dt},
  \quad F_{t}=
\begin{cases}
sgn(F_{t}), & {\left|\hat{F}\right|} \ge \mu F_{n} \\
{\hat{F}}_{t}, & {\left|\hat{F}\right|} < \mu F_{n} \\
\end{cases}
\label{eq:tf}
\end{align} 
%
where $k_{t}$ is the stiffness of the tangential spring and $\gamma_{t}$ is the 
damping constant. If $|F_{t}|=\mu F_{n}$, the contact is sliding; otherwise, it 
is non-sliding. It can be noted that the normal force (\cref{eq:nf}) and the 
tangential force (\cref{eq:tf}) are handled in the same way in DEM. When the 
grains slide against each other, they do not retain any memory 
of their initial position, and hence do not return to their original position. 
In order to model this behaviour, a limiting value of $\delta_{t}$ is imposed. 
When the contact slides, $\delta_{t}=\pm\mu F_{n}/k_{t}$ is imposed.

In addition to sliding, the grains can roll relative to one another around 
their centre of mass due to the tangential force acting at their contact 
surfaces. In which case, $d\delta_{t}/dt=0$. It is important to assume that the 
grains touch 
at a single point instead of overlapping, i.e. $\delta_{n}=0$. This point is 
located at 
${x}_{\mathit{i}}-r_{\mathit{i}}\mathbf{n}={x}_{\mathit{j}}+r_{\mathit{j}}\mathbf{n}$.
 If we consider that this point belongs to grain $\mathit{i}$, its velocity is 
${v}_{\mathit{i}}+r_{\mathit{i}}(\mbox{\boldmath${\omega}$}\times\mathbf{n})$. 
If it belongs to grain \textit{j}, its velocity is 
${v}_{\mathit{j}}+r_{\mathit{j}}(\mbox{\boldmath${\omega}$}\times\mathbf{n})$. 
The relative velocity is the difference between these two velocities. 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\delta_{t}}{dt}=(\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{i}}-{\mathbf{v}}_{\mathit{j}})\cdot 
\mathbf{t} 
-(r_{\mathit{i}} \mbox{\boldmath${\omega}$}_{\mathit{i}}
+r_{\mathit{j}}\mbox{\boldmath${\omega}$}_{\mathit{j}})\times\mathbf{n} \,.
\label{eq:rf}
\end{equation}
%
It should be noted that~\cref{eq:rf} is only an approximation, as the 
grains in DEM do not touch at points, but overlap. It is therefore an 
approximation that produces an error of order 
$\mathbf{\mathit{O}}(\delta_{n}/r)$~\citep{Radjai2011}. It is 
assumed that the contact forces are exerted at the point of contact, which 
implies that the tangential force is accompanied by torque acting on two 
grains. If the overlap is zero, these torques are
%
\begin{align}
\tau_{\mathit{ij}} & = -(a_{\mathit{i}}\mathbf{n})\times(F_{t}\mathbf{t}) \,,\\
\tau_{\mathit{ji}} & = -(a_{\mathit{j}}\mathbf{n})\times(F_{t}\mathbf{t}) \,.
\label{eq:av}
\end{align}
%
The torques modify the angular velocities of the grains. It is therefore 
necessary to incorporate the equation for the angular coordinates of the grains 
in~\cref{eq:fma}
%
\begin{equation}
\mathit{I}_{j}\frac{d\omega_{i}}{dt}=\sum\limits_{j\ne i}{\tau_{ij}} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathit{I}_{j}$ is the moment of inertia of grain j. Eq~\ref{eq:av} is 
only valid when $\delta_{n}=0$. The torque is a vector product of the force and 
its lever arm. It is assumed that the lever arms have lengths equal to 
$r_{\mathit{i}}$ and $r_{\mathit{j}}$, which is true only when the grains do 
not overlap. Hence in this case they produce an error of order 
$\mathbf{\mathit{O}}(\delta_{n}/r)$. It is nevertheless desirable to damp this 
type of motion~\citep{Radjai2011}. A rolling resistance can be adopted in order 
to model the shape effect of non-spherical grains, which accounts for moments 
arising from the fact that the line of action of the normal contact force in 
the case of non-spherical particles no longer passes through the centre of mass
of the particles and hence generates rotational moments.

The interaction between two solid bodies is much more complex than that 
described by the simple linear model. Nevertheless, the linear force law has 
several advantages. It is simple to implement, and its harmonic behaviour is 
well-understood, which makes it easier to interpret the results. The 
most common non-linear interaction law is the Hertz law~\citep{Hertz1882}. In 
certain situations, such as a quasi-static packing, a non-linear law can have 
significant influence on the acoustic properties and on the global 
stiffness~\citep{Agnolin2007}. However, in the case of rapid granular flows, 
the interaction force between the grains has almost no effect on the 
phenomenon, and a linear law can be used to describe this kind of 
behaviour~\citep{Radjai2011}. 

%****************************************************************************

\subsection{Numerical algorithm and integration scheme}
The efficiency of a DEM algorithm is mainly determined by 
its efficiency for computing the interaction forces between grains. If we 
consider a model system with pairwise interactions, then we have to consider 
the contribution of the force on grain \textit{i} due to all of its neighbours. 
If we consider only the interaction between a grain and the nearest image of 
another grain, then for a system of \textit{N} grains, we must evaluate $N 
\times (N-1)/2$ pair distances. Consider a system of 1000 grains. At every time 
step, all possible pairs of grains have to be considered to compute the 
interaction forces, and hence, $\mathit{N}(\mathit{N}-1)/2 \approx 500,000$ 
force 
computations are required. For short-range grain interactions, the majority of 
these force evaluations is unnecessary as the corresponding grains are located 
far apart and do not necessarily touch each other. For a dense system of 
equally sized grains, the grains can have contacts with not more than 6 grains, 
thereby reducing the number of force computations required to $3\mathit{N} 
\approx 
3000$. In the preliminary force computation scheme, at least 166 times more 
pair interactions are considered than necessary. Therefore, the numerical 
methods employed in the DEM should try to minimise the computation of 
interaction forces~\citep{Poschel2005}. There are three different methods for 
the efficient computation of the forces the \textit{Verlet} algorithm, the 
\textit{link-cell} algorithm, and a \textit{lattice} algorithm. The 
\textit{Verlet} algorithm described in~\citet{Grubmuller1991} 
is implemented in the present study.

\subsubsection{Verlet list algorithm}
The Verlet list algorithm assumes a cut-off value, so that only neighbouring 
grains that contribute to the energy of grain \textit{i} are considered. It 
is advantageous to exclude the grains that do not interact in the 
memory-expensive energy computation.~\citet{Verlet1967} developed a 
book-keeping 
technique, commonly referred to as the Verlet list or neighbour list, which is 
illustrated in~\cref{fig:Verletb}. In this method, a second cut-off radius 
$r_{\mathit{v}}>r_{c}$ is introduced, and before the interactions are 
calculated, a list is made (the Verlet list) of all grains within a radius 
$r_{\mathit{v}}$ of the grain \textit{i}. In the subsequent calculations of the 
interactions, only those grains in this list will be considered. The idea of 
the Verlet algorithm is based on a simple property of grain dynamics: 
the neighbourhood relation between grains can only change slowly, i.e. two 
grains which are close to each other at a given time step will remain as 
neighbours, at least in the following few time steps. During initialization, 
the neighbourhood relations between the grains, i.e. the distance of all close 
pairs of grains, are computed. Two grains are considered to be neighbours if 
the distance of their surfaces is smaller than a predefined distance, termed the
\textit{Verlet distance}
%
\begin{equation}
(\left|\overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{i}}}-\overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{j}}}\right|
-\mathit{R}_{\mathit{i}}-\mathit{R}_{\mathit{j}})<\mbox{\textit{Verlet
 distance}} \,.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[tbhp]	
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Verletb}
\caption[Verlet list algorithm for neighbourhood search.]{The Verlet list: a 
grain \textit{i} interacts with 
those grains with 
the cut-off radius $r_{c}$. The Verlet list contains all the grains within 
a sphere with radius 
$r_{\mathit{v}>r_{c}}$.}
\label{fig:Verletb}
\end{figure}

For each grain, there is a \textit{Verlet list} in which the close 
neighbours are saved. To initialise the Verlet lists efficiently, a grid that 
covers the simulation area is defined. Its mesh size is larger than the largest 
grain. For construction of the lists, only pairs whose grains reside in the 
same or adjacent grids are considered. This procedure guarantees the detection 
of all close pairs of grains~\citep{Poschel2005}. Redundancy in Verlet lists, 
i.e. 
if grain \textit{i} is a neighbour of \textit{j}, then grain \textit{j} is 
a neighbour of \textit{i}, is avoided by imposing a restriction on the list of 
grain \textit{i}, such that it contains only neighbours with index 
$\mathit{j}<\mathit{i}$. For the computation of interaction forces, the Verlet 
list of grain \textit{i} is scanned, and only pairs which are recorded in one 
of the Verlet lists are considered. Hence, the Verlet list of each grain 
\textit{i} is scanned, and the interaction force of \textit{i} with each entry 
\textit{j} in its list is computed. 

Initially, to build the Verlet list, the grains are sorted into a grid of mesh 
size $\mathit{dx}\times\mathit{dy}$. For each grid, there is a list of grains 
residing in the cell. During the simulation, the neighbourhood relation among 
the grains change; therefore, the Verlet lists have to be updated. The decision 
to update a Verlet list depends on how far the grains have travelled since the 
time when the present list was built. The Verlet list of a grain \textit{i} 
must contain at any time all neighbours \textit{j} with 
$\mathit{j}<\mathit{i}$. This assures that two grains \textit{i} and 
\textit{j} never touch and are not considered as neighbours, i.e. \textit{j} is 
not in the list of \textit{i}, and \textit{i} is not in the list of \textit{j}. 
Hence,
%
\begin{equation}
\left|\overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{i}}}-\overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{j}}}\right|
-\mathit{R}_{\mathit{i}}-\mathit{R}_{\mathit{j}}>0 \,.
\end{equation}

The above condition is required for all pairs $(\mathit{i},\mathit{j})$ of 
grains which are \textit{not} known as neighbours. This condition is a 
criterion to update the Verlet lists~\citep{Poschel2005}. Assume at the instant 
when the Verlet lists are constructed that the surfaces of the grains have the 
distance $\left| \overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{i}}} - 
\overrightarrow{r_{\mathit{i}}}\right| - 
\mathit{R}_{\mathit{i}}-\mathit{R}_{\mathit{j}} > 
\mbox{Verlet distance}$, i.e. they are not classified as neighbours. If the 
Verlet lists are updated before one of these grains has travelled the distance 
$\mathit{verlet distance}/2$ since the lists were constructed then they can 
never collide without being recognised as neighbours first. This is explained 
in~\cref{fig:Verlet}. The impact of optimisation of the Verlet list 
algorithm has negligible effect on the computation time, as the algorithm is 
quite efficient already and only consumes a small percentage of the total 
computation time in construction of the Verlet lists. The implementation of the 
Verlet list algorithm in force computation drastically reduces the computation 
time in comparison to the linear algorithm. The performance of the Verlet list 
algorithm is controlled by two crucial parameters: the number of cells 
$\mathit{N}_{\mathit{c}}$, for the construction of the Verlet lists and the 
Verlet distance $r_{\mathit{v}}$~\citep{Poschel2005}.

\subsubsection{Leap frog, or Verlet integration algorithm}

The Discrete Element Method involves numerically solving Newton's equation of 
motion~\cref{eq:fma}, which is an ordinary differential equation. Choosing an 
integration algorithm is important, as the forces are not always differentiable 
in time, and the temporary derivative of the force is discontinuous when the 
contact splits. It is also essential to numerically integrate~\cref{eq:rf} 
with the same precision as~\cref{eq:fma}. At first, computational speed seems 
important. However, it is usually not very relevant because the fraction of 
time spent on integrating the equation of motions (as opposed to computing the 
interactions) is negligible. Accuracy for large time steps is more important 
because the larger the time step used, the fewer evaluations of the forces 
needed per unit of simulation time. Hence, it is advantageous to use a 
sophisticated algorithm that allows use of larger time step. 

Algorithms that allow the use of large time steps achieve efficiency by storing 
information on increasingly higher-order derivatives of the 
grain coordinates. Consequently, they tend to require more memory storage. 
However, the most important aspect to consider is the energy conservation. It 
is important to distinguish between two kinds of energy conservation: the short-
term and the long-term. The sophisticated higher-order algorithms tend to have 
very good energy conservation for short times. However, they often have 
undesirable features that result in drifting of the overall energy for longer 
times. In contrast, the Verlet-style algorithms tend to have only moderate 
short-term energy conservation, but little long-term drift~\citep{Frenkel1996}. 
In this case, such algorithms are not useful. They are more complicated to 
program, and they do not yield a more precise solution~\citep{Radjai2011}. It 
might be important to have an algorithm that accurately predicts the 
trajectories of all grains for both short and long durations, however no such 
algorithm exists.


In certain cases, two trajectories that are initially very close may diverge 
exponentially as time progresses. Any integration error, however small it may 
be, will always diverge the predicted trajectory exponentially from the true 
trajectory. This phenomenon is called the Lyapunov instability, and it poses a 
serious threat to the fundamental basis of DEM simulations. 
However, this problem might not be serious~\citep{Frenkel1996}. The aim of DEM 
is not to predict precisely what will happen to a system, but to predict the 
average behaviour of the system that is prepared in an initial state about 
which we 
know something (initial position, velocity and energy), but not everything. 
Hence, DEM differs from other methods, which are used to predict the 
trajectories. However, considerable numerical evidence suggests that 
the shadow orbits exists, which is a true trajectory of a multi-body system 
that closely follows the numerical trajectory for a time that is longer in 
comparison with the time that is required for the Lyapunov instability to 
develop~\citep{Frenkel1996}.

Because Newtons's equations of motions are time-reversible, so too should the 
integration algorithms be time-reversible. The ``leapfrog'' algorithm, or the 
Verlet integration algorithm, is a numerical scheme used to integrate the 
Newton's equation of motion to calculate the trajectories of grains and is 
implemented in DEM by~\citet{Verlet1967}. The Verlet algorithm is 
fast and requires less storage memory. It is not particularly accurate for long 
time steps, and hence, we should expect to compute the forces on all grains 
rather frequently. Its short-term energy conservation is satisfied (in versions 
that use more accurate expression for velocity), but most importantly, it 
exhibits little long-term energy drifts. This is related to the fact that the 
Verlet algorithm is time-reversible and area preserving. However, it does not 
conserve the total energy of the system exactly~\citep{Frenkel1996}. The Verlet 
algorithm is simply based on a truncated Taylor expansion of grain 
coordinates. 
%
\begin{equation}
t(t+\Delta t)=r{t} +\mathbf{v}(t) \Delta t + \frac{f(t)}{2\mathit{m}} \Delta 
t^{2}+ \dots
\end{equation}
%
If we truncate this expansion beyond the term $\Delta t^{2}$, we obtain Euler's 
algorithm, which looks similar to the Verlet Algorithm, but it does not 
preserve energy and it has significant energy drifts. The simplest among the 
Verlet schemes is the \textit{Leap frog algorithm}, which evaluates the 
velocities at half-integer time steps and uses these velocities to compute the 
new positions. The position of each grain is calculated at time $t=0, \Delta t, 
2\Delta t, $\dots$ ,$ where $\Delta t$ is the time step. On the other hand, 
their velocities are calculated at intermediate times, that is, at $t=\Delta 
t/2, 3 \Delta t/2, \dots,$. Let the position of a grain at time $t=k\Delta t$ 
be written as $x_{\mathit{k}}$, and its velocity at time $t=\Delta t (k + 
1/2)$ be written $\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k + 1/2}}$, and its acceleration at $t=k 
\Delta t$ be $\mathbf{a}_{\mathit{k}}$. Then the following equation is used to 
advance systematically
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:verlet}
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k}+1/2} & 
=\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k}-1/2}+\mathbf{a}_{\mathit{k}}
 \Delta t, \\
x_{\mathit{k}+1} & =x_{\mathit{k}}+\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k}+1/2} \Delta t
\end{align}
%
This algorithm determines the new grain position with an error of order 
$\mathit{O}( \Delta t^{4})$. But~\cref{eq:verlet} hides a difficulty in the 
application of this algorithm to granular materials~\citep{Radjai2011}. This 
difficulty is the calculation of acceleration at time $t=k\Delta t$. The 
velocities are known at $t=(k - 1/2) \Delta t$, but not at $t=k \Delta 
t$. One option for resolving this problem is to write
%
\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k}}={\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{k}-1/2}+{\mathbf{a}_{\mathit{k}-1}\Delta
 t/2}} \,.
\label{eq:ver}
\end{equation}
%
The equation uses the acceleration of the preceding time step to estimate the 
velocity. This approximation does not diminish the order of the 
algorithm. Eq~\ref{eq:ver} estimates $\mathbf{v}_{k}$ with an error of order 
$\mathbf{O}(\Delta t^{2})$, producing an error of the same order in the 
calculation of the force in~\cref{eq:verlet}. But this causes only an error of 
order $\mathbf{O}(\Delta t^{3})$ in the velocity and an error of order 
$\mathbf{O}(\Delta t^{4})$ in the position. However, this problem does not 
exist in energy conservation systems, because the computed forces do not depend 
on the velocities of the grains. The heaviest computational task is the 
evaluation of forces, not the integration of equations. The Verlet 
integration scheme is summarised in~\cref{eq:vers} and~\cref{fig:verlet}. To 
calculate the forces and acceleration, it requires the positions and velocities 
at time \textit{t}:
%
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}(t+\Delta t/2) & =\mathbf{v}(t-\Delta t/2) + \mathbf{a}(t) \Delta t 
\nonumber \,, \\
x(t+\Delta t) & = x(t)+\mathbf{v}(t+\Delta /2) \Delta t  \,, \nonumber \\
 \mathbf{v}(t) & = \mathbf{v}(t-\Delta t /2)+\mathbf{a}(t- \Delta t) \Delta t 
 /2 \,.
\label{eq:vers}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Leap}
\caption{Illustration of the \textit{Verlet} integration scheme.}
\label{fig:verlet}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the DEM formulation reveals that the linear 
force law gives the model a harmonic character, showing that it is very closely 
related to simple models widely applied in physics and mechanics. The shortest 
time scales often arise from the oscillations of one or two grains. The 
integration algorithm must resolve these movements with sufficient precision. 
Thus, the time steps used must be smaller than these time scales; the most 
rapid frequency is usually ${\omega}_{\mathit{N}}$, the characteristic 
oscillation frequency of very short waves. This frequency is proportional to 
$\omega _{o}$, which is easier to estimate. Therefore, it is essential 
to choose a time step $\Delta t \approx \epsilon / \omega_{0}$, where 
$\epsilon$ is a constant that depends on the integration algorithm. Values such 
as $\epsilon \approx 0.01$ are often a reasonable choice~\citep{Radjai2011}. In 
the case of rapid granular flows, the time step must be small enough so that 
the fastest grains move only by a small fraction of their size during one 
time step. The grains must be stiff enough so that violent collisions do not 
lead to large overlaps between grains.

\subsection{Boundary conditions}

In many cases, the dynamic and static properties of a granular system are 
substantially affected by the interaction of the granular material within the 
system boundaries, i.e. by the properties of the container or the surface on 
which the material is present. The effect of boundary conditions on 
the response of the granular assembly can be noticed in the convective motion 
of granular material in vibrating containers, the formation of density waves in 
pipes, the motion of granular material on conveyors, and the clogging of 
hoppers. In these and many other cases, careful definition of the interaction 
between the granular material and the contact surface is essential. Of 
particular importance is the realistic modelling of the wall surface roughness. 
Unfortunately, the mechanical interaction of granular materials with a rough 
wall is poorly understood~\citep{Poschel2005}. A simple way to define the wall 
property is to build up the wall from grains which obey the same rules of 
interaction as the grains of granular material. By varying the size and 
position of the wall grains, system boundaries of adjustable roughness can be 
described. However, the surface roughness that characterises the frictional 
properties of the wall has to be derived iteratively and may not represent the 
real conditions. In the present case, a solid wall with corresponding 
stiffness, damping and frictional characteristics is introduced to model the 
interaction between grains and the wall. The interaction force is computed in a 
similar fashion to that of a pair of grains in contact and is divided into the 
normal and tangential components. The compression of the grain upon collision 
with the wall is calculated along the normal direction to the wall and 
the grain contact.

\subsubsection{Periodic boundary} \label{sec:periodic}
The effect of a wall on the response of grains is very critical, especially 
in numerical simulations where the number of grains is relatively fewer in 
comparison to the number of grains in experimental conditions. The undesired 
effect of a wall can be eliminated using periodic boundary conditions, i.e. a 
periodic extension of the simulation 
area in one or more dimensions. Any grain leaving the system at one side is 
reintroduced at the opposite side, and correspondingly, the interaction 
forces between grains at opposite sides of the simulation area are taken into 
account. In this framework, the simulation domain becomes a unit area 
containing grains with periodic copies paving the whole system. The periodic 
boundary conditions extend the system boundaries to infinity, so that the 
simulation cell simply plays the role of a coordinate system for locating grain 
positions (see~\cref{fig:periodic}). 

The external stresses or displacements are applied on the simulation box by 
constraining the degrees of freedom of the wall, which are alternatively kept 
free or fixed depending on whether a stress or a displacement is monitored in a 
system. With periodic boundary conditions, this role is played by the 
collective degrees of freedom carried by the coordinate system, whose basis 
vectors become dynamic variables. Their conjugate stresses are expressed as 
a state function of the granular configuration~\citep{Parrinello1980}. In the 
case of granular systems, there is dissipation of energy during grain 
interactions. The kinematics, equation of dynamics, and the time-stepping 
schemes for DEM are discussed in detail by~\citet{Voiv2011}. The periodicity in 
position implemented in the present study is discussed below. 
%

another grain located at the left boundary.}

\end{figure}

Consider a collection of $N_{p}$ grains with their centres contained 
in a cell of volume \textit{V}. The cell can have any shape allowing for a 
periodic tessellation of space. The simplest shape is a parallelepiped, i.e. 
parallelogram in 2D. The cell and its replicas define a regular lattice 
characterised by its basis vectors 
$(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}_{1}},\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}_{2}})$. In the 
case of a parallelogram, the basis vectors may simply be the two sides of the 
parallelogram:~\cref{fig:periodic}. The origin \textit{O} of the simulation 
cell is a vertex of the cell of coordinates (0, 0) and its replicas are defined 
by two indices $(i_{1}, i_{2})$ corresponding to a translation of the origin by 
the vector 
$i_{1}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}_{1}}+i_{1}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}_{2}}$. 
Then, the coordinates $\overrightarrow{r}(\mathit{i})$ of the image 
$\mathit{i}^{\prime}$ of a grain $\mathit{i} \in \Omega$ of coordinates  
$\overrightarrow{r}(\mathit{i}^{\prime})$ are given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{r}(i^{\prime})=\overrightarrow{r}(i)+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{2}
{\mathit{i}_{\mathit{k}}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mathit{a}}}_{\mathit{k}}} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The grains belonging to the cell $\Omega$, characterised by $\mathit{i}_{1} 
= \mathit{i}_{2} = 0$, can interact with the grains of the same cell but also 
with image grains in the neighbouring cells characterised by $\mathit{i}_{k}\in 
{1, 1}$. There are $3^{D} - 1$ cells surrounding the simulation cell, and they 
are involved in the search of contact partners for each grain. The distance 
between two grains \textit{i} and \textit{j} $\in \Omega$ is the shortest 
distance separating \textit{i} from \textit{j} or from one of its images 
$\mathit{j}^{\prime}$. As the system evolves in time, a grain \textit{i} may 
leave, but one of its images $\mathit{i}^{\prime}$ enters at the same moment. 
In order to keep all original grains in the cell, the status ``original'' 
should be reserved to the grains whose centres belong to $\Omega$. Hence, 
whenever a grain \textit{i} leaves the simulation cell, it becomes an image of 
$\mathit{i}^{\prime}$, which then becomes the original. This means that a 
grain crossing a border of the simulation cell returns to the cell by crossing 
another border.

\subsection{Validation of DEM}

It is essential to validate the developed DEM code. In the present study, a 
preliminary validation of the DEM code is performed by studying a ball rolling 
down an inclined plane.~\citet{O'Sullivan2003} showed that the validation of 
DEM code using the above problem confirms the appropriate implementation of 
the shear contact model in DEM. The theoretical solution for a ball rolling 
down an inclined plane is derived by~\cite{Ke1995}. A disk is resting on a 
rigid inclined plane oriented at an angle $\beta = 45\si{\degree}$ to the 
horizontal plane (\cref{fig:rolling}). The disk has a radius \textit{r} of 
1\si{m} and a 
density of 2650~\si{\kg\per\m\cubed}. The friction angle $\phi$ between the 
disk and the rigid plane is varied. The disk rolls/slides down the plane due to 
gravity. The DEM solution for the sliding case ($\phi=0\si{\degree}$) is 
compared with the theoretical solution by~\citet{Ke1995}. The normal force, 
shear force, angular rotation, accelerations $\ddot{a}$ and angular 
acceleration $\ddot{\theta}$ are compared with the theoretical solution 
(\cref{table:dem_validation}). The accumulation of disk rotation at time 
\textit{t} = 0.2~\si{\s} versus the friction angle is presented 
in~\cref{fig:DEM_Validation}. The angular rotation observed in the DEM matches 
the theoretical solution, which validates the shear contact model. 
The DEM model implemented in the present study is further validated by 
comparing it with the granular column collapse simulations performed 
by~\citet{Zenit2005} and using PFC2D~\citep{ItascaPFC2D1998}.

\subsection[Cumulative beta distribution]{Cumulative $\beta$ distribution}
\label{sec:beta_dist}
For a DEM analysis, the sample must be representative of the 
grain properties, including the particle size distribution (PSD) both in volume 
(mainly for the smallest particles) and in number (for the largest particles). 
This representativeness of PSD is a condition for a sample to be a 
representative volume element. However, this condition cannot be satisfied in 
the DEM for a poly-disperse sample, due to the upper limit on the computation 
capacity. It is important to extract a discrete ensemble of grain sizes such 
that a statistical representation of the size classes is 
obtained~\citep{Radjai2011}.

The $\beta$ distribution in its cumulative form is able to satisfactorily model 
the size span (ratio of the largest to the smallest grain) and the shape 
descriptor (relative weights of the maximum and the minimum grain sizes). The 
cumulative $\beta$ distribution ~\citep{Voivret2007} is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
\beta(x,a,b) = \frac{1}{B(a,b)}\int\limits_{0}^{x}t^{a-1}(1-t)^{b-1}dt \,,
\end{equation}
%
where a > 0 and b > 0 are the two parameters of the distribution. The 
\textit{B(a,b)} function is given by
%
\begin{equation}
B(a,b) = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function defined by
%
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(x) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt \,.
\end{equation}

The cumulative $\beta$ (CB) distribution is defined and normalised in the 
interval [0,1] with $\beta(0) = 0$ and  $\beta(1) = 1$. To represent the 
grading curve of grain size range $[d_{min},d_{max}]$ with CB, the argument 
\textit{x} is replaced by the reduced diameter $d_r$
%
\begin{equation}
d_r(d) = \frac{d - d_{min}}{d_{max} - d_{min}} \,,
\end{equation}
%
which varies in the range of [0,1]. The model grading curve $h(d)$ is given by 
the CD distribution in terms of the reduced diameters as
%
\begin{equation}
h(d,a,b) = \beta(d_r(d);a,b) \,.
\end{equation}

The parameters \textit{a} and \textit{b} of the CB model allow the shape 
descriptor $h(d)$ to vary easily. The size span is characterised by the ratio $ 
r = d_{max}/d_{min}$. The size span can also be defined as
%
\begin{equation}
s = \frac{d_{max}-d_{min}}{d_{max}+d_{min}} \,.
\end{equation}

A value of \textit{s} = 0 indicates a strictly mono-disperse grain size, and a 
value of \textit{s} = 1 indicates an infinitely poly-disperse grain size 
distribution.~\citet{Voivret2007} observed a well-graded particle size 
distribution for \textit{a} > 1 and \textit{b} > 1. 

In the present study, a value of \textit{a} = 4 and \textit{b} = 4 is adopted 
to obtain a well graded curve. In the present study, samples with different 
poly-dispersity \textit{r} = 1.5, 1.8, 2 and 6 are used.~\Cref{fig:DEM_Sample} 
shows a poly-disperse sample $r = 1.5$ generated by the CB method, for 
\textit{a} = 4 and \textit{b} = 4. The PSD curve of the generated 
sample is also presented.

%%*******************************************************************************

\subsection{Particle assembling methods}
In order to simulate a granular assembly, it is essential to assign an initial 
position and velocity to all the grains in the system. Particle positions 
should be chosen to be compatible with the structure (granular fabric) one is 
attempting to simulate. In any event, the grains should not be positioned such 
that there is an appreciable overlap between grains. In order to achieve the 
initial 
position of the grains, various grain-assembling methods can be adopted. The 
grain-assembling methods can be classified into two broad categories: 
dynamic methods and geometrical approaches. The dynamic approach involves 
the packing of grains using laws of mechanics and contacts, while the 
geometrical method involves the packing of grains in accordance with grain 
size, shape and position. In general, the packing of grains can 
be categorised into two types: crystal/lattice packing, like hexagonal or 
square patterns of mono-disperse grains, and random packing with varying 
density employing mono-disperse or poly-disperse grains. The crystalline 
packing 
arrangements, such as hexagon and square lattices, are easier to generate, 
but they have non-trivial effects on the response of the granular 
system~\citep{Staron2005}. Hexagonal packing is the densest possible 
arrangement for mono-dispersed spherical grains. In 2D, the packing of 
mono-dispersed circles on a hexagonal lattice yields a packing density, defined 
as the ratio of volume of solids to the total volume ($V_s / V$), of

The rheology of a granular material is controlled by the geometry of the 
assembly, which includes the grain shape, size distribution, and arrangement. 
This prevailing role of geometry sometimes permits the simplification of the 
dynamics in favour of a better description of the geometry 
and/or higher numerical efficiency~\citep{Radjai2011}. For example, dense 
granular packing may be efficiently constructed by replacing the equations of 
dynamics by simple displacement rules satisfying the geometrical constraints. 
Purely geometrical procedures can be much simpler and numerically faster than 
dynamic or quasi-static methods. Contrary to dynamic simulation methods, 
the geometrical methods allow for quicker assembling of a large number of 
grains. Such packing may then be used as the initial state for dynamic 
simulations. The issue of concern with assembling methods is to construct 
configurations of grains as close as possible to a state of mechanical 
equilibrium with built-in packing properties. This state can be a target 
packing density for a given grain size distribution. In the same way, the 
average connectivity of the 
grains (coordination number) and the anisotropy of the contact network are 
basic geometrical properties. The coordination number represents the mechanical 
response of packing. The homogeneity of the grain assembly in terms of 
packing fraction and connectivity is another important property, which depends 
on the assembling rules. In the present study, the initial grain packing is 
obtained using the ballistic deposition technique.

\subsubsection{Ballistic deposition}
Initially, a random arrangement of grains which do not touch each other is 
generated. The radii of the grains are chosen from the 
interval of $(\mathit{R}_{\mathit{min}},\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}})$ in such a 
way that the total mass of all grains from a certain size interval is the same 
for all sizes, thus ensuring that neither larger nor smaller grains dominate 
the system. 
%This distribution can be obtained, if the radii are 
%chosen according to the probability distribution
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\mathit{p}(\mathit{R})=\frac{\mathit{R}_{\mathit{min}}\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}}}{\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}}
% - \mathit{R}_{\mathit{min}}} \frac{1}{\mathit{R}^{2}} \,.
%\end{equation}
%%
%Random numbers according to the above distribution can be generated from 
%equi-distributed random numbers $\mathit{z}\in [0,1]$ via the transformation
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\mathit{R}=\frac{\mathit{R}_{\mathit{min}}\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}}}{\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}}
% - z(\mathit{R}_{\mathit{max}} - \mathit{R}_{\mathit{min}})}  \,.
%\end{equation}
%%
The 
grains are arranged randomly on a regular lattice. In the second step, the 
grains arranged in a regular lattice are allowed to fall down, maintaining a 
constant potential head between layers of grains (\cref{fig:ini_sample}). 
%
%and are 
%packed using the \textit{random deposition with relaxation method}, a 
%ballistic 
%deposition technique (\cref{fig:ini_sample}). 
%
%The geometrical methods help in 
%this way to improve 
%numerical efficiency in the preparation phase. For example, gravitational 
%deposition of grains located initially on a regular grid can require hours of 
%computation whereas a nearly similar result may be obtained by means of a 
%geometrical method in only a few minutes. The drawback is that the resulting 
%sample will not be in mechanical equilibrium and no information is available 
%on 
%the contact forces. Nevertheless, depending on the relaxation rule, the sample 
%may still be sufficiently close to equilibrium to be considered as a good 
%starting point for mechanical simulations. Hence, a combined approach of 
%ballistic deposition and Discrete Element Method is adopted in the present 
%study to generate mechanically stable samples.

%
%The random deposition and 
%relaxation method, first proposed by~\citet{vold1959a} and developed 
%by~\citet{jullien1992} and \citet{meakin1985}, is adopted in the present 
%study. 
%The general principle of this method is quite simple 
%(\cref{fig:ballistic}); it consists of placing the grains consecutively on 
%a substrate or a layer of already deposited grains. Each grain first 
%touches the substrate or a deposited grain, then undergoes a relaxation 
%process 
%(single-grain restructuring) along the steepest descent (steepest-descent 
%model) until a more stable position according to a stability criterion is 
%reached. 

The construction of the packing proceeds layer by layer from the 
substrate. For this reason, the deposition model is also known as bottom-to-top 
restructuring model. 
%
%The first step is to release a grain from a random 
%position above the substrate. Upon contact with the first deposited grain, the 
%grain rolls following the steepest descent until a new contact is formed with 
%a second grain.
%
In 2D, two contacts are sufficient to balance a grain if its 
centre of gravity lies between the two contacts. This configuration corresponds 
to a position of local stable equilibrium. 
%If this criterion is not met, the grain continues 
%to roll and the procedure is iterated until a local stable position is 
%reached. 
%~\Cref{fig:ballistic} shows a schematic view of the ballistic deposition 
%technique  (the grey grains are periodic images of the black ones).
In this method, the order of deposited grains is generally random and 
independent of their sizes. The mechanically stable sample obtained from this 
method is presented in~\cref{fig:DEM_Sample_r6}. 
Dense granular samples are prepared an initial friction angle of zero. Zero 
frictional resistance ensures the densest possible packing. The friction angle 
is used during the analysis. To generate a dense sample, the sample is 
subjected to vibrations at varying frequencies.

Although there is no optimum specimen generation 
technique~\citep{OSullivan2011}, there is a need to assess the homogeneity of 
the packing density generated~\citep{Jiang2003}. The homogeneity of the sample 
is assessed by measuring the void-ratio within sub-volumes. The generated 
specimen is discretised into horizontal bands of $2.5d_{50}$. The homogeneity 
of the packing is calculated by the variance \textit{S} in the void ratio.
%
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{1}{N_{layer}-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{layer}}(e - e_i)^2 \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $N_{layer}$ is the number of layers and \textit{e} is the overall void 
ratio. A variance \textit{S} of 2.74\% is observed, which is less than 
5\%, indicating a homogeneous sample~\citep{Jiang2003}.


\subsection{Voronoi tessellation}

In order to extract bulk properties, such as packing density, stresses and 
strains, from a DEM simulation, it is important to quantify the granular 
texture. A useful geometrical representation of granular texture consists of 
dividing the space occupied by the particles into contiguous cells. This 
procedure is called `tessellation'. Voronoi tessellation is one of the mostly 
commonly used techniques. For a finite set of points $p_1, \dots, p_n$ in the 
Euclidean space, the domain/plane is discretised into convex polygons such that 
each polygon contains exactly one point, $p_i$ and every point in a given 
polygon is closer to its generating point $p_i$ than to any other. The inverse 
of the Voronoi tessellation is the Delaunay triangulation.

In the present study, the~\citet{Fortune1992} sweep line algorithm is 
implemented to tessellate the region surrounding each grain in the geometry. 
Once each grain has a corresponding area, the macroscopic properties, such as 
the bulk density and stresses, can be extracted from micro-mechanical 
properties, such as the local packing density and force chains.

The Fortune sweep line algorithm involves a sweep line and a beach line, both 
of which move through the plane from left to right as the algorithm progresses. 
The sweep line is a straight line which moves from left to right across the 
plane. At any time during the algorithm, the points (grains) to the left of the 
sweep line will be incorporated into a Voronoi cell. The points on the 
right of the sweep line are yet to be considered. The beach line is a complex 
curve, composed of pieces of parabolas that divide the plane within which the 
Voronoi diagram is known. As the sweep line crosses a point, a parabola 
evolves from the generating point. As the sweep line progresses, the 
vertices of the beach line, at which two parabolas cross, trace out the edges 
of the Voronoi diagram. The beach line progresses by keeping each parabola base 
exactly halfway between the points initially swept over with the sweep line 
and the new position of the sweep line.~\Cref{fig:sweep_voro} shows the Fortune 
sweep line algorithm in progress. A modified version of 
the sweep-line algorithm is used to construct an additively weighted Voronoi 
diagram, in which the distance to each site (grain) is offset by the weight of 
the site, i.e. the radius of the grain.

The Voronoi tessellation is used to study the evolution of packing fraction 
during the collapse of a granular column.~\Cref{fig:tessellation} shows the 
Voronoi tessellation of the run-out for a granular column with an initial 
aspect ratio of 6 at time $t = 3 \tau_c$. The distribution of local packing 
density for the run-out is shown in~\cref{fig:local_density}. Dark regions 
represent dense packing, while loose regions are shown in white. The run-out at 
this stage has a bulk packing density of 81.23\%. It is difficult to tessellate 
the free surface, and the Voronoi cells on the free surface do not represent 
the actual packing density. Hence, during the evaluation of the macroscopic 
density, the packing density of surface grains that are larger than a threshold 
value are ignored. Voronoi Tessellation is a useful tool to extract continuum 
properties from DEM simulations. In the present study, the Voronoi tessellation 
is used to understand the evolution of packing density and entrainment of water 
in the flow front (due to hydroplaning) in granular flows.

\section{Summary}

A plane-strain Material Point Method is implemented in the present study to 
describe the continuum response of granular flows. When a material points 
moves from one cell to another, it results in numerical oscillations called 
the cell-crossing noise. The Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) 
method is adopted to minimise these oscillations in large-deformation problems. 
The grain-scale response is captured using a two-dimensional 
DEM code. The discrete grains are generated using a cumulative $\beta$ 
distribution, which mimics the particle size distribution curves. The sample is 
generated using the ballistic deposition technique, and the homogeneity of the 
generated sample is verified by investigating the variance in the void-ratio at 
different layers. A sweep-line Voronoi tessellation approach is adopted to 
extract macroscopic parameters, such as stresses and packing density, from 
micro-scale properties, such as the local packing fraction. These multi-scale 
tools are used to understand the rheophysics of dry granular flows and to 
evaluate the suitability of MPM as a continuum approach in modelling granular 
flow behaviour.
