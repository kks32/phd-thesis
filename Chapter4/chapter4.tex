\section{Introduction}

The dynamics of a homogeneous granular flow involve at least three distinct 
scales: the \textit{microscopic scale}, which 
is characterised by the contact between grains, the \textit{meso-scale} that 
represents micro-structural effects such as grain rearrangement, and the 
\textit{macroscopic scale}, where geometric correlations can be observed (see 
Figure~\ref{fig:multiscale}). Conventionally, granular flows are modelled as a 
continuum because they exhibit many collective phenomena. However, on a grain 
scale, the granular materials exhibit complex solid-like and/or fluid-like 
behaviour.Recent studies, however, suggest that a continuum law may be unable 
to capture the effect of inhomogeneities at the grain scale level, such as 
orientation of force chains, which are micro-structural effects. Discrete 
element methods (DEM) are capable of simulating these micro-structural effects, 
however they are computationally expensive. In the present study, a multi-scale 
approach is adopted, using both DEM and continuum techniques, to better 
understand the rheology of granular flows and the limitations of continuum 
models.

\section{Granular column collapse}
The collapse of a granular column on a horizontal surface is a simple case of 
granular flow, however a proper model that describes the flow dynamics of this 
simple granular flow is still lacking.~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} performed 
axis-symmetric and plane strain tests on granular column collapse. In the 
present study, multi-scale numerical modelling, i.e. discrete-element and 
continuum analyses, of the quasi-two dimensional collapse of granular columns 
are performed using the Discrete Element Method and the Material Point Method. 
Granular materials when released suddenly on a horizontal surface exhibit 
transient flow. The mechanism of flow initiation, spreading dynamics and energy 
dissipation are studied. The experimental configuration used 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp}. Granular material 
of mass `\textit{M}' was poured into a container to form a rectangular heap of 
length `${L}_{\textit{i}}$', height `${H}_{\textit{i}}$' and thickness 
`\textit{W}'. The internal friction angle and the wall friction between the 
wall and the glass beads measured by ~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} are listed in 
Table~\ref{Table:MP}. The mean packing density of the granular material was 
estimated to vary between 0.61 and 0.65. The gate was then quickly removed to 
release the granular mass that spreads in the horizontal channel until it comes 
to rest. The final run-out distance `${L}_{\textit{f}}$' and the collapsed 
height `$H_{\textit{f}}$' were measured. The run-out distance and collapse 
height were found to exhibit power law relation with the initial aspect ratio 
`\textit{a}' $(=H_{\textit{i}}/L_{\textit{i}})$ of the column.
