\section{Introduction}

The dynamics of a homogeneous granular flow involve at least three distinct 
scales (see Figure~\ref{fig:multiscale}): the \textit{micro-scale}, 
\textit{meso-scale}, and the \textit{macro-scale}. At the microscopic or 
particle scale, the granular material is a discrete system whose physical 
properties are discontinuous with respect to the position and time. On the 
other hand, at the macroscopic or bulk scale, the granular material is a 
continuum system whose physical properties are continuous. Multi-scale 
simulations generally involve modelling the granular materials as an assembly 
of discrete-elements and as a continuum. The Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) 
involves describing the equilibrium conditions, the kinematic conditions, and 
the constitutive behaviour for each particle with respect to its neighbouring 
particles. Whereas, the continuum modelling involves defining those condition 
for an assembly of particles, using the continuum concept of stresses and 
strains.

\section{Granular column collapse}
The collapse of a granular column on a horizontal surface is a simple case of 
granular flow, however a proper model that describes the flow dynamics of this 
simple granular flow is still lacking.~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} performed 
axis-symmetric and plane strain tests on granular column collapse. In the 
present study, multi-scale numerical modelling, i.e. discrete-element and 
continuum analyses, of the quasi-two dimensional collapse of granular columns 
are performed using the Discrete Element Method and the Material Point Method. 
Granular materials when released suddenly on a horizontal surface exhibit 
transient flow. The mechanism of flow initiation, spreading dynamics and energy 
dissipation are studied. The experimental configuration used 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp}. Granular material 
of mass `\textit{M}' was poured into a container to form a rectangular heap of 
length `${L}_{\textit{i}}$', height `${H}_{\textit{i}}$' and thickness 
`\textit{W}'. The internal friction angle and the wall friction between the 
wall and the glass beads measured by ~\citet{Lajeunesse2005} are listed in 
Table~\ref{Table:MP}. The mean packing density of the granular material was 
estimated to vary between 0.61 and 0.65. The gate was then quickly removed to 
release the granular mass that spreads in the horizontal channel until it comes 
to rest. The final run-out distance `${L}_{\textit{f}}$' and the collapsed 
height `$H_{\textit{f}}$' were measured. The run-out distance and collapse 
height were found to exhibit power law relation with the initial aspect ratio 
`\textit{a}' $(=H_{\textit{i}}/L_{\textit{i}})$ of the column.
