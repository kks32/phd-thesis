\section{Introduction}

The dynamics of a homogeneous granular flow involve at least three distinct 
scales: the \textit{microscopic scale}, which 
is characterised by the contact between grains, the \textit{meso-scale} that 
represents micro-structural effects such as grain rearrangement, and the 
\textit{macroscopic scale}, where geometric correlations can be observed (see 
Figure~\ref{fig:multiscale}). Conventionally, granular flows are modelled as a 
continuum because they exhibit many collective phenomena. However, on a grain 
scale, the granular materials exhibit complex solid-like and/or fluid-like 
behaviour.Recent studies, however, suggest that a continuum law may be unable 
to capture the effect of inhomogeneities at the grain scale level, such as 
orientation of force chains, which are micro-structural effects. Discrete 
element methods (DEM) are capable of simulating these micro-structural effects, 
however they are computationally expensive. In the present study, a multi-scale 
approach is adopted, using both DEM and continuum techniques, to better 
understand the rheology of granular flows and the limitations of continuum 
models.

\section{Granular column collapse}

The collapse of a granular column on a horizontal surface is a simple case of 
granular flow, however a proper model that describes the flow dynamics is still
lacking. Granular flow is modelled as a frictional dissipation process in 
continuum mechanics but studies showing the lack of influence of inter-particle 
friction on the energy dissipation and spreading dynamics is surprising. 
In the present study, the generalised interpolation material point method 
(GIMPM), a hybrid Eulerian -- Lagrangian approach, is implemented with 
Mohr-Coloumb failure criterion to describe the continuum behaviour of quasi-two 
dimensional collapse of granular columns. The granular column collapse is also 
simulated using DEM to understand the micro-mechanics of the flow.

The granular column collapse experiment involves filling a cylinder of height 
$H_0$ and width $L_0$ with a granular material of mass `m'. The granular column 
is then released \textit{en masse} by quickly removing the cylinder, thus 
allowing the granular material to collapse onto the horizontal surface, forming 
a deposit having a final height $H_f$ and radius $L_f$ . A computational study 
on an equivalent two-dimensional configuration (circular disks) was carried out 
using Discrete Element and Continuum (MPM) approaches.

~\citet{Lajeunesse2004} performed axis-symmetric and plane strain tests on 
granular column collapse. Granular materials when released suddenly on a 
horizontal surface exhibit transient flow. The mechanism of flow initiation, 
spreading dynamics and energy dissipation are studied. The experimental 
configuration used by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp}. 
Granular material of mass `\textit{M}' was poured into a container to form a 
rectangular heap of length `${L}_{\textit{i}}$', height `${H}_{\textit{i}}$' 
and thickness `\textit{W}'. The internal friction angle and the wall friction 
between the wall and the glass beads measured by ~\citet{Lajeunesse2004} are 
listed in Table~\ref{table:mat_prop}. The gate was then quickly removed to 
release the granular mass that spreads in the horizontal channel until it comes 
to rest. The final run-out distance `${L}_{\textit{f}}$' and the collapsed 
height `$H_{\textit{f}}$' were measured. The run-out distance and collapse 
height were found to exhibit power law relation with the initial aspect ratio 
`\textit{a}' $(=H_{\textit{i}}/L_{\textit{i}})$ of the column.

In this study, numerical simulations of the granular column collapse 
experiments are performed by varying the initial aspect ratio of the column. 
Discrete Element Method simulations involve modelling the granular column as 
individual particles. The granular column is prepared by randomly packing 
poly-disperse grains on a regular lattice and allowing them to undergo free 
fall due to gravity, forming a randomly packed granular column (see \mynote{Add 
Chapter reference} %TODO: Add 
%Chapter). 
The grains are allowed to reach a stable equilibrium after undergoing some 
elastic compressions due to gravity. 
The overlaps between particles are determined by the stiffness 
$\textit{k}_{\textit{n}}$ of the spring in the normal direction. Typically, 
average overlaps in the range 0.1 to 1.0\% are desirable and the spring 
constant is chosen to produce particle overlaps in this range. The stiffness is 
determined using the following equation:
\begin{align}
& \textit{k}_{\textit{n}}=\frac{2 \pi G}{(1-\nu)[2\ln(\frac{2r}{A})-1]} \\ 
& A = [\frac{2r(1-\nu)f_{n}}{\pi G}]^{\frac{1	}{2}}
\end{align}
where $f_{n}$ is the normal contact force; G is the shear modulus; $\nu$ is the 
Poisson's ratio and r is the radius of the grain. A simpler form of stiffness 
for a spherical grain is defined as:
\begin{align}
& \textit{k}_{\textit{n}}=4ER
\end{align}
where E is the Young's modulus of the material and R is the radius of the 
grain. The normal damping coefficient $C_{\textit{n}}$ is chosen to give a 
required coefficient of restitution $\varepsilon$ (defined as the ratio of the 
post-collisional to pre-collisional normal component of the relative velocity) 
for the materials involved:
\begin{align}
& C_{\textit{n}}=2\gamma \sqrt{m_{\textit{ij}}k_{\textit{n}}} \\ 
& \mbox{where} \quad \gamma = -\frac{\ln(\varepsilon)}{\sqrt{\pi^{2}+\ln^2 
(\varepsilon)}},\quad \mbox{and} \quad 
\textit{m}_{\textit{ij}}=\frac{\textit{m}_{\textit{i}}\textit{m}_{\textit{j}}}{\textit{m}_{\textit{i}}
 + \textit{m}_{\textit{j}}} 
\end{align}
10 Discrete Element Method simulations were carried out with columns having 
different initial aspect ratio `\textit{a}', varying from 0.2 to 10. In order 
to study the effect of crystallisation on the run-out distance, 10 more MD 
simulations were carried out on granular columns composed of grains arranged on 
a hexagonal lattice. In order to maintain a threshold amount of grains, in all 
the cases the columns contain at least 1000 grains, which is the safe lower 
limit for DEM as suggested by~\citet{Oda1999}. The micro-mechanical parameters 
used in this study are presented in Table.~\ref{table:MDdata}. Due to the 
unsteady nature of the flow, the grains get dispersed on the horizontal plane 
as discrete bodies start to separate from the main mass, hence the run-out 
distance is calculated as the position of the farthest grain which has at least 
one contact with the main mass.

A plane strain collapse of granular column is simulated as a continuum using 
MPM. The effect of number of material points on the accuracy of the simulation 
was discussed in Chapter 4.~\citet{Guilkey2003} suggests at least four 
particles per cell for problems involving large deformations. 10 MPM 
simulations of the granular column collapse were performed using Mohr-Coulomb 
constitutive law by varying the initial aspect ratio, to understand the 
difference between the particle and continuum scale description of granular 
flows. The parameters used for the continuum analyses are presented in 
Table.~\ref{table:MPMData}. The Young's modulus of the granular assembly is 
determined by performing a uni-axial compression of the granular column in 
Discrete Element Method.

\subsection{Deposit morphology}
The variation of the normalized final run-out distance, $\Delta L = 
(L_{\textit{f}}-L_{\textit{i}})/L_{\textit{i}}$, with the initial aspect ratio 
`a' of the column is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:run-out}. Similar to the 
experimental results, a power law relationship is observed between the 
normalized run-out distance and the initial aspect ratio of the column. 
However, the molecular dynamics simulations with random packing of grains 
overestimate the run-out distance by a factor of 1.2. In the present study, the 
following scaling law for the run-out is observed.
\begin{align}
\frac{L_{\textit{f}}-L_{\textit{i}}}{L_{\textit{i}}} \approx  
\begin{cases}
1.67 a, &\qquad \textit{a}\lesssim 2.3 \\
2.5 a^{2/3}, &\qquad \textit{a} \gtrsim 2.3 \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
The run-out distance observed in the case of hexagonal packing of grains 
matches the experimental run-out distance observed by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}. 
However, the Discrete Element Method simulations performed with random packing 
predict longer run-out distances in comparison with the experimental data. The 
difference in the run-out distance can be attributed to the variation in the 
packing of grains in the granular column. Although, experimental data 
corresponds to granular column collapse in a rectangular channel, the collapse 
is not a pure two-dimensional collapse as in the case of numerical simulations. 
This can cause some variation in the run-out distance.~\citet{Balmforth2005} 
observed that the material property affects the final run-out distance and 
included a pre-factor `$\lambda$' in the scaling law, which is in contrast to 
the observation made by~\citet{Lube2005},. The scaling law observed in the 
present study for the random packing is identical to the scaling law observed 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}, except for the pre-factor in the scaling law, 
indicating a strong correlation between the run-out distance and the material 
property.~\citet{Daerr1999} also observed the effect of initial packing density 
and the internal structure on the behaviour of granular flows. The continuum 
description of the granular column collapse using Material Point Method shows 
good agreement with the experimental results for columns with lower aspect 
ratio (`\textit{a}' $\lesssim 2.3$), however it exhibits a significant increase 
in the run-out distance beyond the aspect ratio of 2.3.~\citet{Bandara2013} 
also observed a jump in the run-out distance at the initial aspect ratio of 2.

In order to understand the mechanism of the run-out in a granular column 
collapse, it is essential to study the relation between the final collapsed 
height of the granular column and its initial aspect ratio. 
Figure~\ref{fig:height} shows the variation of the normalized final height with 
the initial aspect ratio of the column. The final height predicted by the 
Discrete Element Method and the MPM simulations matches the experimental data 
for 
granular columns with aspect ratio below 0.7, which indicates that the initial 
density of the column has negligible effect on the final collapse height. The 
scaling of final height of the column with the initial aspect ratio of the 
column can be written as:
\begin{align}
\frac{H_{\textit{f}}}{L_{\textit{i}}} \propto  
\begin{cases}
\textit{a}, \qquad & \textit{a}\lesssim0.7 \\
\textit{a}^{2/3}, \qquad & \textit{a}\gtrsim0.7 \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
The Material Point Method predicts a higher final height of the column in 
comparison with the particular simulations that should result in shorter 
run-outs, however it is inconsistent with the observations. In case of granular 
columns with smaller aspect ratios, only a tiny portion of the total mass is 
mobilized and the rest remains static, thus predicting the final collapse 
height accurately. The final height of a column is controlled by the amount of 
static region in the granular column collapse, while the run-out distance is 
essentially a function of the flowing mass. Hence, it is essential to compare 
the evolution of flow and the internal flow structure in the Discrete Element 
Method 
and Material Point Method simulations to understand the limitations of both the 
continuum and discrete element approaches.

\subsection{Flow evolution and internal flow structure}
For a fixed granular material and substrate properties, the flow dynamics and 
the final deposit morphology do not depend on the volume of granular material 
released, but depend only on the aspect ratio `\textit{a}' of the column. A 
power law relationship is observed between the run-out distance and the initial 
aspect ratio of the column. A transition in the run-out behaviour at an aspect 
ratio of 2.3 indicates a change in the flow dynamics. For smaller aspect 
ratios, the granular mass fails through avalanching of flanks producing a 
truncated cone-like deposit (`\textit{a}' < 0.7) or conical deposit 
(`\textit{a}' > 0.7). At smaller values of aspect ratios, the flow is initiated 
by failure at the edge of the pile along a well-defined fracture surface. The 
grains located above the failure surface move ``\textit{en masse}'' leaving a 
static region underneath the failure surface. After a transient time of order 
$\tau_{c}$, defined as $\sqrt{H_{\textit{i}}/g}$, the flow is fully developed. 
The velocity profile along the granular column at critical time $\tau_{c}$ is 
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:a04tc}. At critical time, the velocity field 
depends only on the position of the grain along the sliding mass. The maximum 
velocity is observed at the front of the flowing mass corresponding to that of 
a plug flow in horizontal direction. Particulate and continuum simulations 
yield similar run-out distance at critical time. Unlike particulate 
simulations, the Material point method predicts that the maximum horizontal 
velocity occurs at the top of the sliding mass. Behind the fast flowing front, 
the flow is localized in the mass above the failure surface and the velocity 
profiles are locally parallel to the failure plane. The flow is composed of 
upper linear part and a lower exponential tail in the static granular bed. The 
velocity profile is similar to steady granular surface flow as observed 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}. 

For columns with lower initial aspect ratios, the run-out distance is 
proportional to the mass flowing above the failure surface. To understand the 
amount of mass mobilized during a collapse, the angle of the failure surface 
has to be studied. Figure~\ref{fig:a04tc} shows a distinct failure surface 
when the flow is fully developed at critical time $\tau_{\textit{c}}$. The 
angle of the failure surface is found to be about $55^{o}$. The failure surface 
begins from the toe of the column and protrudes inwards at an angle of 50 to 
$55^{o}$. For columns with lower aspect ratios, the formation of the 
``truncated conical deposit'' or ``conical deposit'' depends only on the 
initial length of the column, as the angle of the failure surface is found to 
be independent of the aspect ratio. The failure angle is consistent with the 
interpretation in terms of \textit{active Coulomb 
failure}~\citep{Lajeunesse2004}, which leads to a predicted failure angle 
$\theta_{\textit{y}}=45^{o}+\delta / 2$, where $\delta$ is the internal 
friction angle of the granular material. In the present study, the friction 
angle of the glass beads is $22^{o}$, which leads to 
$\theta_{\textit{y}}=45^{o}+22^{o}/ 2=56^{o}$, which is in good agreement with 
the numerical simulations and experimental observations 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}. Contrary to the suggestion 
of~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}, the fracture angle is found to have no direct effect 
on the transition between the truncated cone and the conical deposit occurring 
at an aspect ratio of 0.7.~\citet{Schaeffer1990} observed the onset of 
instabilities in a narrow wedges of $56\mbox{ to }65^{o}$ for Cambridge type 
constitutive models that describes granular flows. This observation matches 
well with the failure angle observed in the present study. The final profile of 
the collapsed granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 0.4 is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:a04f}. The failure surface is distinct and the hexagonal dense 
packing of grains has a steeper failure surface in comparison with the random 
packing. The variation observed in the angle of the failure surface causes a 
difference in the amount of mobilized mass above the failure surface, and in 
turn in the run-out distance. The lower value of run-out distance observed in 
the case of hexagonal packing of grains can be attributed to the 
crystallisation effects. crystallisation is the formation of large-scale 
lattice structures during the flow, resulting in non-generic flow patterns. 
crystallisation is found to have a significant effect on the final state of the 
granular column.~\citet{Lacaze2009} observed that poly-disperse grains have 
lesser tendency to crystallize especially in the case of columns with larger 
aspect ratio.

\end{figure}


For larger aspect ratios, the flow is still initiated by a well defined failure 
surface as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:a6tc}. However, in this case the 
initial granular column is much higher than the top of the failure surface. Due 
to gravity most of the grains in the column fall in the vertical direction 
consuming the column along their way. When they reach the vicinity of the 
failure surface, the flow gets deviated along the horizontal direction 
releasing a huge amount of kinetic energy gained during the free fall. For 
larger aspect ratio (\textit{a} > 0.7), the resulting static region is a cone, 
the final height of the cone, i.e, $\textit{H}_{\textit{f}}$ lies above the 
summit of the failure surface. Hence, a different evolution is observed from 
that of the axis-symmetric geometry~\citep{Lube2005}, where the final height 
coincides with the summit of the failure surface forming a truncated conical 
deposit.~\citet{Lajeunesse2004} articulated the variation in the deposit 
morphology between the axis-symmetric case and the rectangular collapse to be a 
geometrical effect rather than as an experimental artefact. The final profile 
of the collapsed granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 6 is presented 
in Figure.\ref{fig:a6f}. An initial failure surface starting from the toe end 
of the column at an angle of about 55$^{o}$ can be observed at critical time 
$\tau_{c}$. As the collapse of the granular collapse progresses, successive 
failure planes parallel to the initial failure surface are formed and shear 
failure occurs along these planes. The presence of several shear bands in the 
final profile of the collapsed granular column confirms the hypothesis. 
crystallisation in hexagonal packing causes a significant effect on the run-out 
distance by forming series of parallel shear bands. However, the Material Point 
Method fails to capture the formation of shear bands during the collapse. This 
observation throws light on the mechanics of propagation of shear bands in 
massive landslides such as the Storegga submarine landslide. The flow behaviour 
becomes similar to that of columns with lower aspect ratio as the flow starts 
descending along the failure plane. Regardless of the experimental 
configuration and the initial aspect ratio of the columns, the flow is 
initiated by a well-defined rupture surface, above which the material slides 
down leaving a static region underneath the failure plane. Depending on the 
aspect ratio of the column, two asymptotic behaviours are observed. For smaller 
aspect ratios, the flow is dominated by friction and by the pressure gradient 
for larger aspect ratio.

To study the flow dynamics of granular columns with different aspect ratios, 
the flow front \textit{L}(\textit{t}) and the maximum height of column 
\textit{H}(\textit{t}) are tracked. The evolution of scaled height 
$(H_{\textit{f}}/L_{\textit{i}})$ and the run-out distance 
$(L_{\textit{f}}-L_{\textit{i}})/L_{\textit{i}}$ with time for granular columns 
with an initial aspect ratio of 0.4 and 6 are presented in 
Figures.~\ref{fig:flowa04} and~\ref{fig:flowa6}. Time is scaled with respect to 
the critical time $\tau_{c}$, defined as the time at which the flow is fully 
mobilized. Three distinct regions can be observed in the flow evolution of 
granular column collapse regardless of the initial aspect ratio of the column. 
An initial transient acceleration phase is observed for a time 0.8$\tau_{c}$. 
This phase is followed by a heap movement of granular materials at the foot 
with a constant spreading velocity \textit{V} for about 2$\tau_{c}$. When time 
`\textit{t}' $> \tau_{c}$, the velocity varies linearly with depth in the 
flowing layer and decreases exponentially with depth near the static layer. 
This velocity profile is similar to those observed in steady granular surface 
flows~\citep{Lajeunesse2004}. Most of the run-out happens during this phase. 
The final phase involves deceleration of the flow front and the flow comes to 
rest after 0.6$\tau_{c}$. The spreading of the granular column ceases after a 
time in the order of 3$\tau_{c}$ for all values of aspect ratios, however some 
motion still persists along the free surface behind the flow front for a much 
longer time due to internal rearrangement, the duration of which can last up to 
$\textit{t} \approx 6\tau_{c}$. For smaller aspect ratios, the critical time is 
evaluated as the point of intersection of the scaled run-out and height. The 
critical time predicted for both hexagonal and random packing of grains matches 
the experimental observations. However, the Material Point Method overestimates 
the critical time by a factor of 1.25, which means that it takes longer for the 
flow to be fully mobilized. However, the actual run-out duration is short and 
the granular materials comes to rest abruptly at about $\textit{t}=3\tau_{c}$. 
For columns with larger aspect ratios, the continuum and particulate approaches 
simulate similar flow evolution behaviour for times up to 3$\tau_{c}$, beyond 
which particulate simulations stabilise and come to rest, while the flow 
continues to evolve in MPM simulations resulting in larger run-outs than 
expected. The flow tends to come to rest at time $\textit{t}=6\tau_{c}$. The 
three phases in a granular flow can be distinctly observed in the flow 
evolution plot for a granular column with initial aspect ratio of 6 (see 
Figure~\cref{fig:flowa6}). For larger aspect ratios, the flow evolution 
behaviour 
observed in the case of random packing matches the experimental observation 
by~\citet{Lajeunesse2004}. Hexagonal packing predicts longer time for the flow 
to evolve, which can be attributed to the increase in the internal resistance 
due to crystallisation of grains. MPM overestimates the critical time by 50\%, 
however has the same value of run-out as the particulate simulations, at time 
$\textit{t}=3\tau_{c}$, beyond which the material continues to flow until it 
ceases at 6$\tau_{c}$. In order to understand the flow dynamics in the case of 
Material Point Method it is important to study the effect of different 
parameters on the deposit morphology.

\subsection{Energy dissipation mechanism}
\label{sec:energy}
The time evolution of the flow exhibited three distinct stages during the 
collapse of a granular column. Studying the energy dissipation mechanism 
provides useful insight into the flow dynamics. %TODO: Add figure
shows 
the time evolution of potential energy $(E_{p})$ and kinetic energy $(E_{k})$ 
normalized by the initial potential energy $E_{o}$.
\begin{align}
& 
\textit{E}_{\textit{p}}=\sum\limits_{\textit{p}=1}^{\textit{N}_{p}}{\textit{m}_{p}\textit{g}\textit{h}_{p}}
 \\
& 
\textit{E}_{\textit{ki}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{\textit{p}=1}^{\textit{N}_{p}}{\textit{m}_{p}\textit{v}_{\textit{p}}^{2}}
\end{align}
where $\textit{N}_{p}$ is the total number of particles, $\textit{m}_{p}$ is 
the mass of a particle `\textit{p}', $\textit{h}_{p}$ is the height and 
$\textit{v}_{p}$ is the velocity of the particle `\textit{p}'. It can be 
observed from the figure that the initial potential energy stored in the 
particle is converted to kinetic energy which is dissipated as the granular 
material flows down. Three successive stages can be identified in the granular 
column collapse. In the initial acceleration stage $(\textit{t}<0.8\tau_{c})$, 
the initial potential energy stored in the grains is converted into vertical 
motion. In the second stage, the grains undergo collisions with the bottom 
plane and/or with neighbouring grains, and the stored potential energy is 
converted into horizontal motion. In the third stage, the grains eventually 
leave the base area of the column and flow sideways. As the process involves 
collective dynamics of all the particles, it is difficult to predict the exact 
trajectory of a grain, however, the overall dynamics can be explained. To 
explain the dissipation of energy during the collapse,~\citet{Staron2005} 
assumed that the total initial potential energy stored in the system is 
completely dissipated through friction over the entire run-out distance as:
\begin{align}
\mu \textit{m}_{o}g \times (L_{f}-L_{i}) = \textit{m}_{o}g \textit{H}_{o}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the friction coefficient. The model predicts well the flow 
dynamics for columns with larger aspect ratios, as most of the initial 
potential energy is dissipated during the collapse involving the entire column. 
However, for columns with smaller aspect ratios, only a portion of the mass 
above the failure surface is involved in the flow. Hence, the energy 
dissipation should involve only the grains lying above the failure surface. A 
mathematical model, which considers the grains lying above the failure surface, 
will be derived to predict the flow dynamics of the granular column collapse 
for different aspect ratios.

\section{Slopes subjected to impact loading}


\subsection{Numerical procedures}
\label{sec:num}

The numerical samples are composed of $\sim13000$ disks with a uniform 
%plus de simulation pour faire une moyenne ($\sim 6$)
distribution of diameters by volume fractions in the range $[d_{min}, 
d_{max}]$ with $d_{max} = 1.5 d_{min}$. The mean particle diameter and 
mass are $d\simeq 0.0025 $ m and $m\simeq 0.0123$ kg, respectively. 
The particles are first poured uniformly into a rectangular box of given width 
and then the right-hand side wall is shifted further to the right to allow the 
particles to spread. A half-pile is obtained when all particles come to 
rest; see Fig.~\ref{fig:Initial_final_configuration}. This procedure leads to a 
mean packing fraction $\simeq 0.83$.

%\end{figure}

The initial static pile is set into motion by applying a constant horizontal
gradient  $v_{0x}(y) = k (y_{max} - y)$ with $k>0$. Such a configuration 
mimics the energy transfer mechanism of a horizontal quake along the bottom of 
the pile. We are interested in the evolution of the geometry of the pile 
and its total kinetic energy as a function of the initial input energy $E_0$. 
The run-out distance $R_f$ is the distance of the rightmost particles 
from the left wall when the pile comes to rest.  It will be normalized by the 
initial extension $R_0$ of the pile, as in the experiments of collapsing 
columns. The total run-out duration $t_f$ is the time that the pile takes to 
reach its final run-out distance $R_f$.

The initial static pile is set into motion by applying a horizontal velocity 
$v_{0x}(y)$ to all particles during a short interval of time. Different 
velocity fields were tested: 1) The same velocity $v_{0x}(y) = v_0$ applied to 
all particles, 2) The same velocity $v_{0x}(y) = v_0$ applied to a column of 
particles next to the left wall, 3) a constant velocity gradient  $v_{0x}(y) = 
k (y_{max} - y)$ with $k>0$. The first two pushing modes mimic the case of a 
pile impacted from the left by a moving mass (tsunami, debris\dots) whereas the 
last mode represents energy transfer by horizontal quake of the bottom line. We 
will compare briefly below the effect of different pushing modes, but later we 
will mainly explore the third mode. We are interested in the evolution of the 
geometry of the pile and its total kinetic energy as a function of the initial 
energy input $E_0$. The run-out distance $R_f$ is the distance of the rightmost 
particles from the left wall when the pile comes to rest.  
It will be normalized by the initial extension $R_0$ of the pile, as in 
the experiments of collapsing columns. The total run-out duration $t_f$ is the 
time that the pile takes to reach its final run-out distance $R_f$.       

For grain scale simulations, classical Discrete Element Method and Contact 
Dynamics approach is used. 
A detailed description of the Contact Dynamics 
method can be found in \cite{Moreau1993,Jean1999,Radjai2009,Radjai2011}. 
This method is based on implicit time integration of the equations of motion 
and a nonsmooth formulation of mutual exclusion and dry friction between 
particles. The CD method requires no elastic repulsive potential and no 
smoothing of the Coulomb friction law for the determination of forces. 
For this reason, the simulations can be performed with large time steps 
compared to molecular dynamics simulations. The unknown variables are particle 
velocities and contact forces, which are calculated at each time step by taking 
into account the conservation of momenta and the constraints due to mutual 
exclusion between particles and the Coulomb friction. We use an iterative 
research algorithm based on a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel scheme. The only contact 
parameters within the CD method are the friction coefficient $\mu_s$, the 
normal restitution coefficient $e_n$ and the tangential restitution coefficient 
$e_t$ between particles. We will investigate the effect of these parameters on 
the evolution of kinetic energy and the profile of the pile.     
  
The natural units of our system are the mean particle diameter $d$, 
mean particle mass $m$ and gravity $g$. For this reason, 
in the following we normalize the lengths by $d$, the times by $(d/g)^{1/2}$, 
the velocities by $(gd)^{1/2}$ and the energies by $mgd$.

\subsection{Evolution of pile geometry and run-out}
\label{sec:evolution}

In this section, we consider the spreading process following the initial energy 
input into the pile. Fig. \ref{fig:quake_mod} shows several snapshots of the 
pile for an initial input energy $E_0 = 61$ (in dimensionless units).
The pile is sheared from the bottom to the top, thus leaving a cavity in the 
vicinity of the left wall. The cavity is partially filled while the pile 
continues to spread to the right. 


In this section, we consider the spreading process 
following the initial energy input into the pile. 
Fig. \ref{fig:quake_mod} shows several snapshots of the pile 
for each pushing mode and for the same initial 
energy $E_0 = 61$ (in dimensionless units). 
In mode 1, where the same velocity is imparted to 
all particles, the whole pile moves away  from 
the left wall over a short distance and then it 
spreads out and declines in slope. 
 The spreading continues farther until the slope nearly 
declines to zero. In mode 2, where the velocity is applied to 
a  column of particles next to the left wall, the particles belonging to 
the column are literally expelled from the pile. They fall back farther way on 
the pile after 
a ballistic travel above the pile. At the same time, the right side of the 
pile slightly spreads away  
while the left side is filled by the particles rolling down into the gap 
left by the column. In mode 3, the pile is  
sheared from the bottom to the top, leaving thus a cavity in the 
vicinity of the left wall. The cavity is partially filled while the pile 
continues to spread. 

All pushing modes involve a transient with a sharp change 
of the geometry of the pile followed by continuous spreading to the right. 
In mode 2, most of the energy is carried away by the ejected particles. 
In mode 1, the pile has a rigid-body velocity component and moves 
away from the left wall, but shows an efficient energy transfer leading to a 
long run-out distance.      
The transient is more energy consuming in  mode 3  compared to 
mode 1. For this reason, the run-out distance in mode 3 is long but shorter 
than in mode 1. In the following, we analyze in more detail 
the evolution of the pile in mode 3, which mimics a  
horizontal quake from the bottom and, despite the creation of a cavity, 
remains always in contact with the left wall irrespective of the input 
energy.   


Figure \ref{fig:run-out} shows the normalized run-out distance $(R_f - R_0)/R_0$ 
and total run-out time $t_f$ as a function of the input energy $E_0$. We observe 
two regimes both characterized by a power-law run-out distance and time as a 
function of $E_0$. In the first regime, corresponding to the range of low input 
energies $E_0 < 40 \ mgd$, the run-out distance varies as $R_f \propto 
(E_0)^\alpha$ with $\alpha \simeq 0.61 \pm 0.04$ over nearly one decade while 
the duration keeps a constant value  $t_f \simeq 60 \  (d/g)^{0.5}$ 
irrespective of the value of $E_0$! The error  on the value of the exponent 
represents the confidence interval of linear fits on the logarithmic scale.  
%lancer plus de simulation pour une  moyenne 
An average run-out speed can be defined from the ratio $v_s = (R_f - R_0) / 
t_f$. According to the data, we have $v_s \propto (E_0)^{0.61\pm 0.04}$. Since 
the initial average velocity varies as $v_0 \propto (E_0)^{0.5}$, this 
difference between the values of the exponents suggests that the mobilized mass 
during run-out declines when the input energy is increased. As we shall see 
below, the constant run-out time reflects also the collapse of the particles 
into the cavity left behind the pile. 

In the second regime, corresponding to the range of high input energies  $E_0 > 
40 \ mgd$, the run-out distance varies as $R_f \propto (E_0)^{\alpha'}$ over one 
decade with $\alpha' \simeq 0.77\pm 0.03$ while the duration increases as $t_f 
\propto (E_0)^{\beta'}$ with $\beta' \simeq 0.21 \pm 0.04$. Hence, in this 
regime the average run-out speed varies as $v_s \propto (E_0)^{0.56 \pm 0.07}$. 
This exponent is close to the value $0.5$ in $v_0 \propto (E_0)^{0.5}$, and 
hence, within the confidence interval of the exponents, in the second regime we 
may assume $\beta' \simeq \alpha' - 0.5$ and $v_s \propto v_0$. 

It is worth noting that a similar power-law dependence of the 
run-out distance and time were found in the case of 
collapsing columns of grains with respect to the initial aspect ratio 
\cite{Topin2012}.  
In the column geometry, the particles spread away owing to the 
kinetic energy acquired during gravitational collapse of the column. 
Topin et al. found that the run-out distance varies as a power law 
of the available peak kinetic energy at the end of the free-fall stage with an 
exponent $\simeq 0.5$. This value is below those obtained here 
for both regimes. This is, however, physically plausible since the   
distribution of particle kinetic energies at the end of the collapse 
is more chaotic than in our simulations where the energy is supplied 
from the very beginning in a well-defined shear mode. As pointed out 
by \cite{Staron2005}, the distribution of kinetic energies is an essential 
factor for the run-out distance.

\subsection{Decay of kinetic energy}
\label{sec:decay}

The nontrivial evolution of the pile geometry  in two regimes suggests that the 
energy supplied to the pile is not simply dissipated by shear and friction with 
the bottom plane. We also need to split the kinetic energy into its different 
components ($x$, $y$ and rotation) of the velocity field. The input energy 
is in the $x$ component, but due to both the creation of a cavity next to the 
left wall and the rolling of the particles down the free surface of the pile 
and between particles, a fraction of the energy is first transferred to the $y$ 
component of the velocity field and dissipated  during the transient. 
In this section, we analyze these features  in order to arrive in a picture 
consistent with the evolution of the pile shape.  

The decay of the total kinetic energy $E$ is displayed in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:E_vs}(a) for values of the input energy $E_0$. We observe an 
initial fast drop of $E$ followed by a regular fall-off until the end of the 
run-out. This regular fall-off occurs clearly with two different functional 
forms, thus revealing two stages in the evolution of the pile. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:E_vs}(b) shows the same plots normalized by $E_0$. We see that 
all plots corresponding to the first regime (low energies) collapse nearly on 
to a single time evolution. 
%to the first regime (low energies) collapse nearly all along time evolution. 
This is consistent with the fact that, as previously shown, in this 
regime the run-out time $t_f$ is independent of the input energy. In contrast, 
the plots corresponding to the second regime (high energies) collapse only at 
the beginning of run-out, i.e. for $t < t_1 \simeq 7.5 \ (d/g)^{0.5}$.

\label{fig:Normalised_Energy_Time_Slope}
\end{figure}

~\Cref{fig:E_xyt_vs_t} displays the evolution of kinetic energy 
in the translational ($E_x$ and $E_y$) and rotational ($E_\theta$) 
degrees of freedom of the particles. $E_x$ decays as the total 
energy, but $E_y$ and $E_\theta$ increase and pass through a peak before 
decaying rapidly to a negligibly small level. The transient is best observed 
for $E_y$, which has significant values only for $t< t_1$. This energy 
represents the proportion of kinetic energy transferred to the $y$ component of 
the velocity field  due to the destabilization of the pile and collapse of 
particles in the cavity behind the pile. We note that the lower $E_0$, the 
higher the peak value of $E_y/E_0$. 
%mettre une flèche sur les courbes pour montrer la décroissance de E_0
This means that, at low values of the input energy a larger fraction 
of input energy $E_0$ is consumed in the destabilization process whereas 
at a high level of input energy, most of it is dissipated in the spreading 
phase. For this reason, the total duration $t_1$ of this destabilization 
transient is nearly the same in both regimes and its value is controlled by the 
gravity rather than the input energy. The height of the pile being of the order 
of $80 \ d$, the total free-fall time for a particle located at this height is 
$\simeq 12 \ (d/g)^{0.5}$, which is of the same order as $t_1$. As to the 
rotational energy, its contribution both to the transient stage and spreading 
appears to be negligible.

%\label{fig:E_xyt_vs_t}
%\end{figure}

To analyze the second phase in the second regime, we now consider only the 
kinetic energy $E'_{x0}$ available at the end of the transient. This energy 
is responsible for most of the run-out and hence it is expected to control the 
run-out distance and time. Fig. \ref{fig:ExoEx0_vs_t_totau}(a) shows the 
evolution of $E_x$ normalized by $E'_{x0}$ as a function of time. The plots 
have seemingly the same aspect but they show different decay times. A decay 
time $\tau$ can be defined as the time required for $E_x$ to decline by a 
factor $1/2$. Fig. \ref{fig:ExoEx0_vs_t_totau}(b) shows the same data in which 
the time $t'$ elapsed since $t_1$ is normalized by $\tau$. Interestingly, now 
all the data nicely collapse on the same curve. We checked that this curve can 
not be fitted by simple functional forms such as variants of exponential decay. 
This means that the spreading of the pile is not a self-similar process in 
agreement with the fact that the energy fades away in a finite time $t'_f$. 


\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{EkxKoTTau_Slope}
\caption{Evolution of kinetic energy in the $x$ component of 
the velocity field  normalized by the available kinetic energy at the end of 
the transient as a function of normalized time.}
\label{fig:ExEx0_vs_ttau}
\end{figure}


The scaling of the data with the decay time $\tau$ suggests also that the 
run-out time $t'_f$ since the beginning of the second phase might be a simple 
function of $\tau$.~\Cref{fig:ExEx0_vs_ttau} shows both $t'_f$ and $\tau$ as 
a function of $E'_{x0}$, where we observe a power law for both times over 
nearly one decade. The run-out time $t'_f \propto (E'_{x0})^{\beta'}$ has the 
same exponent $\beta' \simeq 0.21 \pm 0.03$ as $t_f$ as a function of $E_0$ 
(see Fig. \ref{fig:run-out}). For the decay time we have 
$\tau \propto (E'_{x0})^{\beta''}$ with $\beta'' \simeq 0.28 \pm 0.03$. The 
relation between the two times can thus be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
t'_f = k  \ \tau \, (E'_{x0})^{\beta'' - \beta'}, 
\label{eqn:t'f}
\end{equation}
where $k \simeq 5 \pm 0.4$ and $\beta'' - \beta' \simeq -0.05 \pm 0.06$. This 
value is small enough to be neglected within the confidence interval of our 
data. It is therefore plausible to assume that  the run-out time is a multiple 
of the decay time and the spreading process is controlled by a single time. We 
however note that a weak dependence on the energy $E'_{x0}$  is consistent with 
the fact that the whole available energy at the beginning of the second phase 
is not dissipated in the spreading process (calculated from the position of the 
tip of the pile) since  the pile keeps deforming by the movements of the 
particles at the free surface even when the tip comes to rest. 
This can explain the small difference between the two exponents as observed 
here.

\subsection{Effect of friction}
\label{sec:parameters}

The run-out distance and time and the dissipation of kinetic energy are 
controlled by the input energy and collective dynamics of the whole pile, as it 
was analyzed in the previous sections. But they are expected to depend also on 
the friction. We performed a series of simulations with different values of 
base friction. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:para} for the profiles of 
the pile and evolution of the kinetic energy in time. We see no difference in 
the results for different values of $e_n = e_t$. This is a consequence of the 
fact that,  even at large input energies, the pile remains in a dense state so 
that multiple collisions inside the pile occur at small time scales compared to 
the deformation time. When the restitution coefficients are increased, more 
collisions occur during a longer time interval but the overall energy 
dissipation rate by collisions remains the same. This effect is a seminal 
example of collective effects which erase the influence of local parameters at 
the macroscopic scale. In contrast with the restitution coefficients, however, 
the effect of the friction coefficient is quite important for the run-out, as 
observed in Fig. \ref{fig:para} for both the energy decay and geometrical 
profile of the pile. Both the run-out distance and decay time decrease as the 
friction coefficient is increased. This effect is much more pronounced at low 
values of the friction coefficient. The run-out time, for example, is reduced by 
a factor 4 as $\mu_s$ is increased from 0.1 to 0.4 while the run-out times and 
profiles do not change much for $\mu_s = 0.7$. This ``saturation effect" was 
evidenced in a systematic way in simple shear tests and explained by the 
observation that the dissipation rate may reach a saturation point where the 
dilation of the granular material and rolling of the particles change in 
response to the increase of the friction coefficient \cite{Estrada2008}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The choice of this geometry was motivated by our main goal  to focus on the 
effect of an input energy on the consecutive dynamics of a granular material.
For the range of input energies investigated in this pushing test by means of 
contact dynamics simulations, we observed a power-law dependence of the 
run-out distance and time with non-trivial exponents. This is a central result 
of this work as it reveals that the power-law behaviour is a generic feature of 
granular dynamics. The values of the exponents are not simple functions of 
the geometry. 

We also evidenced two regimes with different values of the exponents: 
a low-energy regime and a high-energy regime. The first regime  
reflects mainly the destabilization of the pile by the quake with a run-out time 
independent of the input energy whereas the second regime is governed by the 
spreading dynamics induced by the higher value of the input energy. We showed 
that the evolution of the pile in this high-energy regime can be described by a 
characteristic decay time and the energy available at the end of the first 
stage where the pile is destabilized by the quake. 

This work may be pursued along two directions: 1) experimental 
realization of a similar setup with different modes of energy injection and 
2) investigating the effect of various particle shapes or the presence of an 
ambient fluid. Although numerical simulations are generally reliable 
with realistic results found in the past studies of steady flows, we believe 
that the transients are more sensitive situations than steady states and the  
experiments are necessary for checking the validation of the results suggested 
by the simulations. Provided a convenient method is used for supplying kinetic 
energy homogeneously into a pile, our configuration is also interesting for 
the investigation of the behavior of a pile immersed in a viscous 
fluid.

\section{Summary}
Multi-scale simulation of granular column collapse was performed to understand 
the ability and limitations of continuum models to capture the micro-mechanics 
of dense granular flows. The run-out behaviour predicted by both continuum and 
DEM simulations matches for columns with small aspect ratios, where the 
dissipation is predominantly frictional. However, MPM predicts larger run-out 
distances for columns with higher aspect ratios. Energy evolution studies using 
DEM simulations reveal that the run-out behaviour is independent of frictional 
properties of the granular material and collision predominates the initial 
free-fall regime. The lack of a collisional energy dissipation mechanism in MPM 
results in over prediction of run-out distances.
