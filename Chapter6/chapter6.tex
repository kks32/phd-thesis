\section{Introduction}
Avalanches, landslides, and debris flows are geophysical hazards, which involve 
rapid mass movement of granular solids, water, and air as a single phase 
system. Globally, landslides cause billions of pounds in damage, and thousands 
of deaths and injuries each year. Hence, it is important to understand the 
triggering mechanism and the flow evolution. The momentum transfer between the 
discrete and the continuous phases significantly affects the dynamics of the 
flow as a whole~\citep{Topin2012}. Although certain macroscopic models are able 
to capture the simple mechanical behaviours~\citep{Peker2007}, the complex 
physical mechanisms occurring at the grain scale, such as hydrodynamic 
instabilities, formation of clusters, collapse, and 
transport~\citep{Topin2011}, have largely been ignored. In particular, when the 
solid phase reaches a high volume fraction, the strong heterogeneity arising 
from the contact forces between the grains, and the hydrodynamic forces, are 
difficult to integrate into the homogenization process involving global 
averages. 

In order to describe the mechanism of immersed 
granular flows, it is important to consider both the dynamics of the solid 
phase and the role of the ambient fluid~\citep{Denlinger2001}. The dynamics of 
the solid phase alone are insufficient to describe the mechanism of granular 
flows in fluid. It is important to consider the effect of hydrodynamic forces 
that reduce the weight of the solids inducing a transition from dense-compacted 
to dense-suspended flows, and the drag interactions which counteract the 
movement of the solids~\citep{Meruane2010}. Transient regimes characterised by 
a change in the solid fraction, dilation at the onset of flow and the 
development of excess pore-pressure, result in altering the balance between the 
stress carried by the fluid and that carried by the grains, thereby changing 
the overall behaviour of the flow. 

The presence of a fluid phase in a granular medium has profound effects on its 
mechanical behaviour. In dry granular media, the rheology is governed by grain 
inertia and static stresses sustained by the contact network depending on the 
shear-rate and the confining pressure, respectively~\citep{Midi2004}. As the 
fluid inertia and viscosity come into play, complications arise as a result of 
contradictory effects. On one hand, the fluid may delay the onset of
granular flow or prevent the dispersion of the grains by
developing negative pore-pressures~\citep{Pailha2008,Topin2011}. On the other
hand, the fluid lubricates the contacts between grains, enhancing the rate of 
granular flow, but it has a retarding effect at the same time by 
inducing drag forces on the grains. The objective of the present study is to 
understand the differences in the mechanism of flow initiation and kinematics 
between dry and submerged granular flows. In the present study, a coupled 2D 
Lattice-Boltzmann and Discrete Element Method is used to model the fluid-soil 
interactions in  underwater granular flows. The 2D geometry does not take into 
account the movement of grains perpendicular to the plane. Also, due to the 2D 
nature of the geometry fluid flows and fluid-solid interactions in the 
direction perpendicular to the plane are not considered. However, the movement 
of fluid in the plane normal to the direction of flow is minimal and the choice 
of 2D geometry is justified. LBM - DEM approach is computationally expensive as 
it models the fluid - solid interaction at a scale that is orders of 
magnitude smaller than the grain size. It is important to consider a 
representative volume element that is large enough to capture the granular flow 
dynamics in the fluid. The 2D geometry has the advantage of 
cheaper computational effort than a 3D case, making it feasible to simulate 
very large systems. The configuration and parameters studied in this chapter 
are presented in~\cref{table:lbm-dem-setup}.



\section{LBM-DEM permeability}

In a 3D granular assembly, the pore spaces between the grains are 
interconnected, whereas in a 2-D assembly, a non-interconnected pore-fluid 
space is formed as the grains are in contact with each 
other. This means that the fluid enclosed between the grains cannot flow 
to the neighbouring pore-spaces.  This results in an unnatural no flow 
condition in a 2-D case (\cref{fig:reduction}). In order to overcome this 
effect, a reduction in radius is assumed only during the LBM computation (fluid 
and fluid – solid interaction) steps. The reduced radius of the soil grain, 
i.e., the \textit{hydrodynamic radius r}, allows for interconnected pore space 
through which the pore-fluid can flow similar to the 3D behaviour. The 
reduction in the radius is assumed only during LBM computations, hence this 
technique has no effect on the grain – grain interactions computed using DEM.

computation.}
\label{fig:reduction}
\end{figure}

Realistically, the hydrodynamic radius can be varied from $r = 0.7 R$ to 
$0.95 R$, where \textit{R} is the grain radius. Different permeabilities can be 
obtained for any given initial packing by varying the hydrodynamic radius of 
the grains, without having to change the actual granular packing. This 
introduces a new parameter into the system. In a physical sense, a 
hydrodynamic radius represents the three-dimensional permeability of a 
granular assembly simulated as a two-dimensional geometry.

%The hydrodynamic radius can also be assumed to represent the irregularities on 
%the granular surface. 
%The hydrodynamic radius represents asperities on the grain surface, which 
%represents a channel for the fluid to flow between the grains. 


In order to understand the relation between the hydrodynamic radius and the 
permeability of the granular assembly, horizontal permeability tests are 
performed by varying the hydrodynamic radius as 0.7 \textit{R}, 0.75 
\textit{R}, 0.8 \textit{R}, 0.85 \textit{R}, 
0.9 \textit{R} and 0.95 \textit{R}. A square sample of $50~\si{\mm} \times 
50~\si{\mm}$ filled 
with poly-disperse ($d_{max}/d_{min} = 1.8$) grains having a mean diameter of 
1.7~\si{\mm} is used to determine the relation between the hydrodynamic radius 
and the permeability. Dirichlet boundary conditions (discussed 
in~\cref{sec:lbm_bc}), i.e., density constraint, are applied along the left and 
the right boundaries of the sample. The fluid density on the left boundary is 
increased in small steps ($10^{-4} \Delta P$), while a constant density is 
maintained on the right boundary. This results in a pressure gradient  
(\cref{fig:pressure}) causing the fluid to flow through the 
pore-space.~\Cref{fig:velocity} show the horizontal velocity of flow through 
the interconnected pore-space.

	\caption{Evaluation of the horizontal permeability for a 
	hydrodynamic radius of 0.7 \textit{R}.}
	\label{fig:perm}
\end{figure}


For a given hydrodynamic radius, the pressure gradient $\Delta P$ is varied to 
obtain different flow rates. Probing the fluid space showed a Poiseuille flow 
behaviour between the grains. The flow is still within the Darcy's laminar flow 
regime.~\Cref{fig:permeability} shows the linear relationship between the 
applied mean pressure to the mean horizontal flow velocity for different 
hydrodynamic radii, this proves that the flow is laminar. From the mean flow 
velocity (\textit{v}), the transverse permeability (\textit{k}) of the sample 
is computed as
%
\begin{equation}
k=v\cdot\mu\cdot\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta P} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (\si{\Pa\s}), $\Delta x$ is 
the thickness of the bed of porous medium \si{\m}, and $\Delta P$ is the 
applied pressure difference \si{\Pa}. It can be observed that with increase in 
the hydrodynamic radius the permeability decreases, i.e., the slope of the mean 
flow velocity to the pressure gradient decreases. At very low pressure 
gradients 
($\Delta P \le 0.1$), both 0.9 \textit{R} and 0.95 \textit{R} have no flow. 
Even at 
higher pressure gradients, a hydrodynamic radius of $r = 0.95 R$ shows almost 
no 
flow behaviour. A high value of hydrodynamic radius $r > 0.95 R$ 
results in unnatural flow/no-flow behaviour. Hence in the present study, a 
hydrodynamic radius in the range of 0.7 to 0.95 \textit{R} is adopted.

\caption{Variation of the mean flow velocity with pressure gradient for 
different hydrodynamic radius.}
\label{fig:permeability}
\end{figure}


Increasing the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 to 0.95 reduces the quasi-porosity 
from 0.60 to 0.27. The permeability computed from LB – DEM method is verified 
by comparing it with the analytical solution. One of the widely used analytical 
solution for permeability is the Carman – Kozeny equation (CK Model), 
which is based on the Poiseuille's flow through a pipe and is mainly used for 
3D, homogeneous, isotropic, granular porous media at moderate porosities. In 
the present study, a modified Carman – Kozeny equation that takes into account 
of the micro-structure of the fibres and that is valid in a wide range of 
porosities is adopted~\citep{Yazdchi2011}. The normalised permeability is 
defined as
%
\nomenclature[a-Dh]{$D_h$}{Hydraulic diameter}
\nomenclature[a-Sv]{$S_v$}{Total wetted surface}
\nomenclature[a-av]{$a_v$}{Specific surface area}
\nomenclature[g-psick]{$\psi_{CK}$}{Empirically measured Carman – Kozeny factor}
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{k}{d^2} = \frac{\epsilon}{\psi_{CK}(1-\epsilon)^2} \,.
\end{equation}
%
In the CK model, the hydraulic diameter $D_h$ , is expressed as a function of 
measurable quantities: porosity and specific surface area
%
\begin{align}
D_h & = \frac{4\epsilon V}{S_v}=\frac{\epsilon d}{(1 - \epsilon)} \,, \\
a_v & = \frac{\mbox{grain surface}}{\mbox{grain volume}} = 
\frac{S_v}{(1-\epsilon V)} = \frac{4}{d} \,,
\end{align}
%
where $S_v$ is the total wetted surface, and $a_v$ is the specific surface 
area. The above value of $a_v$ is for circles (cylinders) - for spheres $a_v = 
6/d$. $\psi_{CK}$ is the empirically  measured CK factor, which represents both 
the shape factor and the deviation of flow direction from that in a duct. It is 
approximated for randomly packed beds of spherical grains. The variation of 
normalised permeability with porosity, obtained by varying the radius from 0.7 R
to 0.95 \textit{R}, is presented in~\cref{fig:Carman}. The permeability values 
obtained 
from LBM - DEM simulations are found to match the qualitative trend of the 
Carman-Kozeny equation. The LB – DEM permeability curve lies between the 
permeability curves for spherical and cylindrical grain arrangements implying a 
better simulation of three-dimensional permeability using a 2D granular 
assembly. Thus using a hydrodynamic radius, realistic 3D fluid - grain 
interactions can be simulated in a 2D geometry.

\section{Granular collapse in fluid}

The collapse of a granular column, which mimics the
collapse of a cliff, has been extensively studied in the case of
dry granular material, when the interstitial fluid plays no
role (\cref{sec:dry_granular_column}). The problem of the granular collapse 
in a liquid, which is of importance for submarine landslides, has attracted 
less attention~\citep{Rondon2011}.~\citet{Thompson2007} 
observed that the presence of liquid dramatically changes the way a granular 
column collapses compared to the dry case. The destabilization of a granular 
pile strongly depends on the initial volume fraction. For dense 
packings the granular flow is localised at the free surface of the pile, 
whereas for loose packings the destabilization occurs in the bulk of the
material and has a parabolic profile~\citep{Bonnet2010,Topin2011,Iverson2000}. 

\subsection{LBM-DEM set-up}

In the present study, the collapse of a granular column in fluid is studied 
using 2D LBM - DEM. The effect of initial aspect ratio on the run-out behaviour 
is investigated. The flow kinematics are compared with the dry and buoyant 
granular collapse to understand the influence of hydrodynamic forces and 
lubrication on the run-out. Unlike dry column, the permeability and the 
initial volume fraction are expected to have a significant influence on the 
flow dynamics. Hence the effect of these parameters on the run-out behaviour 
is investigated.

The granular column collapse set-up in fluid is very similar to the dry 
granular column collapse. A rectangular channel of length $L_0$ and height 
$H_0$ is filled with poly-dispersed discs, $d_{max}/d_{min} = 1.8$  
(\cref{fig:geometry}). Once the DEM soil grains reach equilibrium in the dry 
condition, the granular sample is then placed in the fluid domain simulated 
using LBM. The LBM-DEM set-up of a granular column with an aspect ratio 
\textit{a} of 6 in fluid is shown in~\cref{fig:LBMgeometry}. The fluid has a 
density of 
\SI{1000}{\kg\per\cubic\meter}  and a kinematic viscosity of 
\SI{1e-6}{\square\meter\per\second}. The gate supporting the right-hand 
side 
boundary of the granular column is opened allowing the column to collapse and 
flow in a fluid. The final run-out distance is measured as $L_f$ and 
final collapse height as $H_f$. The collapse takes place on a horizontal 
surface. The initial aspect ratio of the column is varied as 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 
0.8, 1, 2, 4 and 6.

\end{figure}


The cumulative $\beta$ distribution is adopted to generate a distribution of 
grain sizes ($d_{max}$ = \SI{2.2}{\milli\meter}, $d_{min}$ = 
\SI{1.25}{\milli\meter}). The soil column is modelled using $\sim 2000$ discs 
of density \SI{2650}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} and a contact friction angle of 
\SI{26}{\degree}. A linear-elastic contact model is used in the
DEM simulations. The granular assembly has a packing fraction of $83\%$. The 
critical time step for DEM is computed based on the local 
contact natural frequency and damping ratio. A sub-cycling time integration is 
adopted in DEM (\cref{sec:coupled_lbm_dem}). A fluid flow (LBM) time step 
of $\Delta t = 2.0\times 10^{-5}$\si{\s} is determined based on the viscosity 
and the relaxation parameter $\tau = 0.506$. An integer ratio $n_s$, between 
the fluid flow time step $\Delta t$ and the DEM time step $\Delta t_D$ is 
determined as 15, i.e., every LBM iteration involves a sub-cycle of 15 DEM 
iterations.

In order to capture the realistic physical behaviour of the fluid – grain 
systems, it is essential to model the boundary condition between the fluid and 
the grain as a non-slip boundary condition, i.e. the fluid near the grain 
should have similar velocity as the grain boundary. The solid grains inside the 
fluid are represented by lattice nodes. The discrete nature of the lattice 
results in a stepwise representation of the surfaces (\cref{fig:LBM-DEM}), 
which are otherwise circular, hence sufficiently small lattice spacing $h$ is 
required. The smallest DEM grain in the system controls the size of the 
lattice. In the present study, a very fine discretisation of $d_{min}/h = 10$ 
is adopted, i.e., the smallest grain with a diameter $d_{min}$ in the system is 
discretised into 100 lattice nodes ($ 10h \times 10h$). This provides a very 
accurate representation of the interaction between the solid and the fluid 
nodes.  A hydrodynamic radius of 0.7 \textit{R} is adopted during the LBM 
computations. 
The fluid pressure on the top and right boundaries are maintained constant. 
Hence, any pressure wave that is generated during the collapse is absorbed in 
the boundary. Frictional boundary constraint is applied along the bottom 
boundary.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Collapse in fluid: Flow evolution}
\label{sec:collapse_fluid_evolution}
Two-dimensional plane-strain LBM-DEM simulations of granular column 
collapse are performed by varying the initial aspect ratio of the column from 
0.2 to 6. The normalised final run-out distance is measured as $\Delta L = 
(L_{\textit{f}}-L_{\textit{0}})/L_{\textit{0}}$. Similar to the dry granular 
collapse, the duration of collapse is normalised with a critical time $\tau_c 
= \sqrt{H/g}$, where $H$ is the initial height of the granular column and 
\textit{g} is the acceleration due to gravity. Dry and buoyant analyses of 
granular column collapse are also performed to understand the effect of 
hydrodynamic forces on the run-out distance.

Snapshots of the flow evolution of a granular column collapse with an initial 
aspect ratio of 0.4 are shown in~\cref{fig:a04_snapshots}. The failure begins 
at the toe end of the column, and the shear-failure surface propagates into the 
column at an angle of about $50\si{\degree}$, similar to the dry column 
collapse. For the short column, the failure is due to collapse of the flank. 
Once the material is destabilised, the granular mass interacts with the 
surrounding fluid resulting in formation of turbulent vortices. These vortices 
interact with the grains at the surface resulting in an irregular free surface. 
Force chains can be observed in the static region of collapse, which indicates 
the granular flow in fluid can still be described using continuum theories. As 
the granular material ceases to flow, force chains develop at the flow front, 
revealing consolidation of the granular mass resulting in an increase in the 
shear strength.

The evolution of normalised run-out $(L_f - L_0)/L_0$ with normalised time 
$t/\tau_c$ for a short column (a = 0.4) in dry and submerged conditions is 
presented in~\cref{fig:Runout_a04f}. The dry column exhibits longer run-out 
distance in comparison to the submerged column. The collapse of a dry column 
using DEM represents a collapse in a vacuum, without any influence of drag 
forces or viscosity of air. A LBM-DEM simulation of a granular column collapse 
using the kinematic viscosity of air is performed to compare the dry column 
with the collapse in air. Although the effect of viscous drag can be observed 
in the collapse in the air, both the ``dry'' condition and the 
collapse in air show almost the same run-out behaviour. However, the collapse 
in fluid (water) results in a much shorter run-out distance. The granular mass 
in fluid has the buoyant mass, in contrast to the dry density. A dry granular 
collapse with the buoyant unit weight also exhibits longer run-out behaviour 
than the collapse in fluid. However, due to 
decrease in the initial potential energy, the run-out observed in the buoyant 
condition is shorter than the dry condition. The column collapse in fluid takes 
longer to evolve, which might be due to the development 
of large negative pore water pressure that is generated during the shear 
failure along the shear-failure surface. This large negative pore-pressure has 
to be 
dissipated before the granular mass, above the shear-failure surface, can 
collapse 
and flow. The shorter run-out distance in the fluid case, in comparison with 
the dry and buoyant conditions, shows that the collapse in fluid is 
significantly affected by the hydrodynamic drag forces acting on the soil 
grains. The evolution of normalised height $H/L$ with time under dry and 
submerged conditions is presented in~\cref{fig:Height_a04f}. Since the 
failure of the column is only at the flank, the central static region remains 
unaffected. Hence, the final height of the column is the same in both dry and 
submerged conditions.

\end{figure}

The evolution of the normalised kinetic energy $E_k / E_{p0}$ with time under 
dry 
and submerged conditions for a column with an initial aspect ratio of 0.4 is 
shown in~\cref{fig:a04f_energy}. It can be 
observed that the peak kinetic energy is attained later in the submerged 
condition than the dry collapse. This can be attributed to the time required to 
overcome the negative pore-pressure generated during the shear along the 
shear-failure surface. For short columns the critical time $\tau_c$ is 
controlled by 
the vertical kinetic energy. The amount of kinetic energy in submerged case is 
significantly lower than the dry condition. Also, the evolution of the 
normalised potential energy $E_{p}/E_{p0}$ with time under dry and submerged 
conditions is presented in~\cref{fig:PE_a04f}. The potential energy drops 
faster in dry and buoyant conditions in comparison to submerged condition. This 
shows a significant influence of the hydrodynamic forces on the amount of 
material destabilised during the collapse. The drag forces on the soil grains 
reduce and slow down the amount of material that undergo collapse resulting in 
a shorter run-out distance for the collapse of short columns in fluid.

Snapshots of the flow evolution of a granular column collapse with an initial 
aspect ratio of 4 is shown in~\cref{fig:a4_snapshots}. For a tall column, the 
collapse mechanism changes. The entire column is involved in the collapse. The 
height of the static region, which is below the shear-failure surface, is 
shorter than the total height of the column. This results in a free-fall of 
grains above the shear-failure surface. As the grains experience free-fall they 
interact with the surrounding fluid. However, no vortices are observed during 
the initial stage of collapse. In the second phase, when the grains reach the 
base, the vertical velocity gained during the free-fall is converted into
horizontal velocity. As the grains are ejected horizontally, the free 
surface of the granular mass interacts with the fluid resulting in the 
formation of turbulent vortices. Unlike short columns, these vortices have 
a significant influence on the mass distribution along the run-out. Heaps of 
granular material can be observed in front of each vortex. The number of 
vortices formed during a collapse is found to be proportional to the amount of 
material destabilised, i.e., the length of free-surface interacting with the 
fluid influences the number of vortices generated during the collapse. The 
reappearance of force chains at $t = 6\tau_c$ and $8\tau_c$ indicates the 
granular mass is consolidating resulting in an increase in the shear strength.

The time evolution of the run-out and the height of a tall column (a = 4) is 
presented in~\cref{fig:Runout_a4f} and~\cref{fig:Height_a4f}, respectively. 
Similar to the short column, the run-out observed in the dry condition is much 
longer than that observed in the submerged condition. Also, the evolution of 
run-out is slower in the case of submerged condition, which indicates the 
influence of drag force on the run-out 
evolution.~\Cref{fig:Height_a4f,fig:PE_a4f} shows the evolution of normalised 
height and potential energy with time. The submerged column collapse at a 
slower rate than its dry counterpart. The hydrodynamic forces in fluid causes 
an increase in the drag force thus reducing the amount of 
material destabilised during the collapse.

The evolution of kinetic energies with time for an initial aspect ratio 4 is 
presented in~\cref{fig:a4f_energy}. Even during the free-fall stage, the peak 
vertical kinetic energy is delayed in the case of fluid, which shows the 
influence of viscosity on the flow evolution. Almost half of the kinetic energy 
that is available in the case of dry granular collapse is dissipated through 
the drag forces experienced by the grains. This shows that the influence of 
viscous drag on the run-out evolution is significantly higher than the effect 
of lubrication.

The normalised final run-out distance as a function of the initial aspect ratio 
of the column under dry and submerged conditions is presented 
in~\cref{fig:runoutf}. For all aspect ratios, the run-out observed in 
the dry case is significantly higher than the submerged condition. For short 
columns, the run-out distance is found to be have a linear relationship with 
the initial aspect ratio of the column.  A power law 
relation is observed between the run-out and the initial aspect ratio of the 
column.

The normalised final height as a function of the initial aspect ratio 
of the column under dry and submerged conditions is presented 
in~\cref{fig:heightf}. It can be observed that the 
final collapse height is much higher in the submerged condition than the dry 
collapse. The drag force on the granular column reduces the amount of 
granular mass participating in the collapse, resulting in a shorter run-out 
distance. The drag force seems to have a predominant influence on the run-out 
behaviour than the lubrication effect in fluid.

\subsection{Effect of permeability}
\citet{Topin2011} using Direct Numerical Simulation of underwater granular 
collapse observed development of large negative pore-pressures during 
dispersion of grains. The rate of dissipation of the negative pore-pressure is 
directly proportional to the permeability of the granular assembly. In the 
previous section, the evolution of run-out with the initial aspect ratio is 
studied using a constant hydrodynamic radius \textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R}. In 
order to understand the effect of permeability on the run-out behaviour, the 
hydrodynamic radius \textit{r} is varied from 0.7 \textit{R} to 0.95 \textit{R} 
for all aspect ratios. Increase in the hydrodynamic radius decreases the 
permeability of the granular assembly resulting in a longer duration for the 
dissipation of negative pore-pressure. 

The normalised run-out for different hydrodynamic radii for a granular column 
with an initial aspect ratio of 0.8 are presented 
in~\cref{fig:Runout_a08_dense}. The run-out increases with decrease in the 
permeability, which is equivalent to an increase in the hydrodynamic radius. 
An increase in the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 to 0.95 \textit{R} increases 
the normalised run-out by 25\%. However, even under a very low permeability 
condition (\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}), the run-out observed in fluid is 
shorter than the dry and the buoyant conditions. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Runout_a08_dense}
\caption{Effect of permeability on the evolution of run-out for a column 
collapse in fluid (a = 0.8).}
\label{fig:Runout_a08_dense}
\end{figure}

At a high permeability (\textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R}), the evolution of run-out 
at the initial stage is quicker, which means that the negative pore-pressure 
that is developed during the shearing along the shear-failure surface is 
dissipated faster. Even though the negative pore-pressure is dissipated, due to 
the development of negative pore-pressure the evolution of run-out in fluid is 
slower than its dry counterpart. The rate of pore-pressure dissipation 
decreases with decrease in the permeability. This can be observed by a flatter 
slope in the run-out evolution with decrease in the 
permeability.~\Cref{fig:PWP_ini_dense} shows the distribution of pore-pressure 
in high and low permeability granular media along the horizontal direction at a 
height of $10 \times d$ from the base. In LBM, the pore-pressure in fluid is a 
function of fluid density distribution functions. At time $t = \tau_c$, the 
highly permeable (\textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R}) granular column 
shows smaller negative pore-pressure in comparison to large negative 
pore-pressures observed in the shearing zone of a low permeable column 
(\textit{r} = 0.9 R). This shows that not only does it take longer for the 
pore-pressure to dissipate with a decrease in permeability, but also results in 
almost twice the negative pore-pressure than what is observed in the high 
permeable case (\cref{fig:r095_PWP_ini_dense,fig:r095_PWPress_ini_dense}). A 
high value of positive pore-pressure is observed at the face of the column 
in the low permeable condition. This indicates that the low permeable column 
fails as a continuous block undergoing a shear failure, which generates a very 
large negative pore-pressure along the failure surface. However, in the case of 
the high permeable column the failure is more localised with multiple negative 
pore-pressure spikes (\cref{fig:r07_PWPress_ini_dense}).

\end{figure}

Although the low permeability granular columns require a longer duration for 
the run-out to evolve, the final run-out distance is found to be much longer 
than in the high permeable condition.~\Cref{fig:PE_a08_dense} shows that the 
potential energy mobilised during the flow of a low permeability column is 20\% 
smaller than the collapse of a high permeability granular column. Normalised 
kinetic energy evolution with time (\cref{fig:a08_dense_energy}) shows that the 
low permeability column has a wider peak kinetic energy distribution in 
comparison to a sharp peak observed in the high permeability condition. This 
indicates the influence of lubrication, i.e., hydroplaning of the granular flow 
in low permeability conditions. The evolution of the horizontal kinetic energy 
with time reveals that the peak kinetic energy is sustained longer as the 
permeability of the granular material decreases (\cref{fig:KExy_a08_dense}). 
Although the peak kinetic energy is smaller in the low permeability case, the 
hydroplaning of the flowing granular mass results in a longer run-out 
distance.~\Cref{fig:r095_PWP_flow_dense,fig:r095_PWPress_flow_dense} shows the 
distribution of pore-pressure for a dense granular column collapse in fluid 
along the bottom plane. A high positive pore-pressure is observed 
at the base of the granular flow at the flow front in low permeability 
condition indicating the occurrence of hydroplaning. The positive pore-pressure 
at the flow front decreases the effective stress thus the creating lubrication 
effect. The evolution of local packing density with time shows that the packing 
density decreases with decrease in permeability 
(\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense}). This drop 
in the value of packing density between $t = 2\tau_c$ and $t=3\tau_c$ 
corroborates with the duration of hydroplaning during which a large amount of 
water in entrained at the flow front.

\end{figure}


The high permeability granular column shows lower water entrainment 
(\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense}), which indicates that for highly 
permeable flows the drag force acting on the soil grains predominates over the 
lubrication effect on the run-out behaviour.~\Cref{fig:Fr_a08_dense} shows the 
evolution of Froude's number with time for different permeability conditions. 
In dense granular columns, the Froude's number increases with decrease in 
permeability, however the Froude's number is below a critical value of 0.4 even 
for a low permeable column. Hence, no hydroplaning is observed. In both the low 
and high permeable granular flows, the granular material consolidates at the 
final stage of the flow (\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense}). This can be 
observed by the increase in the packing density at the final stage due to 
settlement of grains and expulsion of entrained water. The final deposit 
profile for both low and high permeability conditions are shown 
in~\cref{fig:a08_dense_snapshots}. The high permeability collapse shows a more 
parabolic (convex) deposit profile in contrast to the more concave profile 
observed in the low permeability condition. In high permeable condition, once 
the granular mass is mobilised, the drag forces slows down the rate of flow, 
which allows the grains to densify resulting in a more parabolic profile. This 
is in contrast to the hydroplaning observed in the low permeability condition, 
where the granular mass thickness is smaller than the dense condition. The 
observation of hydroplaning in the low permeable condition may be due to the 
difference in the distribution of granular mass at the flow front. Instigation 
of hydroplaning is controlled by the balance of gravity and inertia forces at 
the debris front and is suitably characterised by the densimetric Froude's 
number:
%
\begin{equation}
Fr_d = \frac{U}{\sqrt{(\frac{\rho_d}{\rho_w}-1)gH\cos\theta}} \,,
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the average velocity of sliding mass, $\rho_p$ and $\rho_w$ are 
the densities of soil and water, respectively, \textit{H} is the thickness of 
the sliding mass, \textit{g} is acceleration due to gravity and $\theta$ 
represents the slope angle.~\citet{Harbitz2003} observed 
hydroplaning above a critical value of densimetric Froude's number of 0.4. A 
Froude's $Fr_d$ value of 0.427 is observed for the low permeable flow 
(\textit{r} = 0.95 
R), which indicates the occurrence of hydroplaning. Whereas, a $Fr_d = 0.273$ 
is observed for the high permeable granular flow indicating absence of 
hydroplaning, the low 
permeable collapse is predominated by the viscous drag force resulting in a 
parabolic profile and shorter run-out distance.

The normalised final run-out distance as a function of the initial aspect ratio 
of the column for different values of permeability and in dry case is presented 
in~\cref{fig:runout_fluid_dry}. For all aspect ratios, the dry condition yields 
the farthest run-out distance. For a given aspect ratio, the dry collapse 
acquires the highest peak kinetic energy due to the lack of viscous dissipation 
during vertical collapse. This extra kinetic energy is high enough to propel 
the heap, in spite of a high frictional dissipation, over a distance that is 
longer than the run-out distance in the fluid regime. In the submerged 
condition, for the same aspect ratio, the kinetic energy available for 
spreading is lower and the dissipation due to viscous drag is higher, thus 
leading to a much shorter run-out distance. 

For short columns, with a decrease in permeability the run-out distance 
increases, however, the run-out distance is not higher than the dry condition. 
At higher aspect ratios, a decrease in permeability from \textit{r} = 0.8 
\textit{R} to 
\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R} 
does not have a significant influence on the run-out behaviour. This can be 
attributed to the turbulent nature of the granular flows for tall 
columns. The run-out behaviour is a result of transformation of (part of) the 
initial potential energy to the peak kinetic energy, which in turn controls the 
subsequent run-out along the plane. For dry and submerged conditions with 
different values of permeability, the run-out distance is plotted as a 
function of the normalised peak kinetic energy 
in~\cref{fig:runout_fluid_dry_energy}. It can be observed that for the same 
aspect ratio, the peak kinetic energy is higher in the case of dry column. This 
represents grain inertial regime in dry granular collapse, which indicates that 
a part of the potential energy, in the presence of the fluid, is dissipated 
during the vertical collapse due to viscous friction. In all regimes, the 
run-out distance increases as a power law $L_f \propto KE_{max}^\gamma$. For 
the same value of peak kinetic energy, the run-out distance in fluid is longer 
than the dry column collapse. Also, with a decrease in 
permeability the run-out distance increases for the same peak kinetic energy.

\subsection{Effect of initial packing density}

\citet{Rondon2011} observed that the loose packings flow rapidly on a time
scale proportional to the initial height and results in longer run-out distance 
in comparison to the dense packing. Hydroplaning occurs above a critical 
Froude's number of 0.4. The Froude's number is inversely related to the 
thickness of the flow and its density. Hence, for the same thickness of flow, a 
loose granular column will experience more hydroplaning than a dense granular 
flow. This effect might result in longer run-out behaviour in fluid than the 
dry condition for the same initial aspect ratio. The initial packing density 
and the permeability of a 2D granular column, with an aspect ratio of 0.8, are 
varied to understand their influence on the run-out behaviour. The run-out 
behaviour of the dense case (83\% packing density), discussed in the previous 
section, is compared with a loose granular column (79\% packing fraction). The 
permeability is varied by changing the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 \textit{R} 
to 0.95 
R. 

The normalised run-out evolution with time for a loose initial packing (79\% 
packing fraction) with different hydrodynamic radii 0.7 \textit{R}, 0.8 
\textit{R}, 0.9 and 0.95 R are presented in~\cref{fig:Runout_a08_loose}. The 
run-out evolution a column of grains in suspension is compared with the dry and 
submerged granular columns to understand the influence of hydrodynamic forces 
on the flow kinematics. Similar to the dense granular column, the run-out 
distance increases with increase in the hydrodynamic radius (i.e., decrease in 
permeability). At low permeabilities (\textit{r} = 0.9 and 0.95 \textit{R}), 
the run-out distance is longer than the dry condition. This shows that the 
lubrication effect in low permeability conditions overcomes the influence of 
the drag force and the development of large negative pore-pressure resulting in 
a longer run-out distance. Although the suspended granular masses experience 
higher drag forces and turbulent effects, the run-out evolves almost at the 
same rate in comparison with granular columns with high permeability. This 
shows the effect of permeability on the dissipation rate of negative 
pore-pressure developed during the initial stage of collapse.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Runout_a08_loose}
\caption{Effect of permeability on the evolution of run-out for a column 
collapse in fluid (a = 0.8 \& loose packing).}
\label{fig:Runout_a08_loose}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:Loose_PWP_ini} shows the development of negative pore-pressure in low 
permeability (\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}) and dissipation of negative 
pore-pressure in high permeability (\textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R}) at the same 
time $ t = \tau_c$. This difference in the quantity and the rate of dissipation 
of negative pore-pressure results in a difference in the rate of flow 
evolution. A low permeability column requires a longer duration to 
evolve.~\Cref{fig:Loose_PWP_flow} shows the distribution of the excess 
pore-pressure along the bottom for low and high permeability conditions. As the 
flow progresses, the low permeability of the granular column causes 
hydroplaning to occur at the base of the column, which can be observed by high 
positive pore-pressure at the base of the flow front 
(\cref{fig:Loose_r095_PWP_flow,fig:Loose_r095_PWPress_flow}), resulting in a 
longer run-out distance.

The evolution of the potential energy with time (\cref{fig:PE_a08_loose}) 
reveals that at a very low permeability (\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}), the 
initial potential energy mobilised is smaller than at \textit{r} = 0.9 
\textit{R}. Also with decreasing permeability, the time required to 
dissipate the negative pore-pressure increases. This results in a shorter 
run-out distance in the case of \textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R} to that of 
\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R}. As the quantity of material destabilised is small, 
the flow is thinner and thus has a high Froude's number 
(0.59).~\Cref{fig:KExy_a08_loose} shows that the peak horizontal kinetic 
velocity observed in the case of \textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R} is higher than 
\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}. A Froude's number of 0.59 for \textit{r} = 0.9 
\textit{R} is observed in contrast to 0.46 for \textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}. 
Both values of hydrodynamic radii result in a Froude's number that indicate the 
occurrence of hydroplaning. However, the difference in the amount of material 
destabilised for \textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R} and the decreased effect of 
hydroplaning results in a shorter run-out distance for \textit{r} = 0.95 
\textit{R} in comparison to \textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R}.


\Cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_loose} shows the evolution of packing 
fraction with time for different values of permeability. As the column 
collapses, water is entrained at the flow front. This can 
observed by the decrease in the packing fraction during $t = \tau_c$ and $t = 
3\tau_c$. As the flow progresses, the entrained water is expelled and the soil 
grains consolidate to reach a critical packing density at the end of the flow. 
The permeability (i.e., hydrodynamic radius) plays a crucial role in the rate 
of dissipation of the entrained water. As the permeability decreases, the water 
entrained at the flow front takes longer time to be dissipated resulting in 
lubrication of the flow at low permeabilities.~\Cref{fig:Fr_a08_loose} shows 
that the low permeable columns exhibit higher Froude's numbers, greater than 
0.4, that indicates occurrence of hydroplaning. This lubrication effect results 
in an increase in the run-out distance for columns with low permeabilities.

The evolution of grain trajectories with time are presented 
in~\cref{fig:Loose_a08_permeability} for low (\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}) and 
high (\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R})
permeability conditions. It can be observed that a high 
permeability column shows a parabolic (convex) final profile in contrast to the 
more concave profile observed in low permeability condition, due to the effect 
of drag forces on the flow front. This difference in the flow thickness results 
in a higher value of Froude's number (0.59) and the occurrence of hydroplaning 
in the low permeability condition. Due to the high permeability, the water 
entrained at the flow front is dissipated quicker and 
thus no lubrication effect is observed. A Froude's number of 0.272 (no 
hydroplaning) is observed for the high permeability condition (\textit{r} = 0.7 
\textit{R}). The 
thick flow front in dense condition results in higher effective stress, in 
contrast to the low effective stress in loose condition due to positive 
pore-pressure at the flow front. The higher effective stress results in more 
frictional dissipation in dense condition, while the loose column experiences
lubrication effect. This shows that the drag force predominates at high 
permeability, while the low permeability condition is characterised by 
hydroplaning and lubrication.

\Cref{fig:effective_stress_a08} shows the normalised pressure at the 
base for the low and high permeability flows at $ t = 2\tau_c$. The normalised 
effective stress plotted is obtained as the average over 5 time steps at 
$2\tau_c$. The effective stress at the base is normalised to the effective 
stress of a static granular column before the collapse. A value of 1 indicates 
that the effective stress hasn't changed, which can be observed in the static 
region of the granular column. It can be observed that the normalised effective 
stress is significantly higher for the high permeability condition at the flow 
front in comparison to the almost non-existence of effective stress in the low 
permeability condition. The observation of trivial effective stress at the flow 
front corroborates the lubrication effect observed at low permeability 
conditions.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:Dense_Loose_PT} shows the grain trajectories of a dense and a loose 
initial packing for a hydrodynamic radius (\textit{r} = 0.95 \textit{R}). It 
can be observed that 
the dense initial packing results in a lot of turbulent behaviour at the flow 
surface in contrast to the more uniform flow behaviour in the loose condition. 
The thickness of the deposit in both dense and loose condition is almost the 
same, however the density of the flow results in a Froude's number of 0.59 and
0.429 for loose and dense conditions, respectively. The low initial density 
results in more hydroplaning in the loose condition. The effect of water 
entrainment at the flow front in dense and loose conditions can be seen 
in~\cref{fig:Dense_Loose_voro}. Water entrainment at the flow front can be 
observed in the loose condition, this is shown by white-coloured (empty Voronoi 
cells) at the flow front. This empty region in the granular packing between the 
granular mass and the base at the flow front represents the entrained water, 
which results in hydroplaning. Comparing the evolution packing densities in 
dense and loose conditions
(\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense,fig:Packing_Density_a08_loose}) 
reveal almost the same packing density when the flow is fully mobilised. Hence, 
it is the density of the flowing granular mass that controls the influence of 
hydroplaning for a given hydrodynamic radius and initial aspect ratio. A 
loosely packed granular column with low permeability entrains 
more water at the flow front, resulting in a hydroplaning effect that overcomes 
the influence of viscous drag forces and thereby yields a higher run-out 
distance than the dry condition.

\citet{Rondon2011} also observed that the collapse of a granular column in a 
viscous fluid is mainly controlled by the initial volume fraction and not by 
the aspect ratio of the column. The role of the initial volume fraction 
observed explains the pore pressure feedback mechanism proposed 
by~\citep{Schaeffer2008,Iverson2000} in the context of landslides. The 
compaction or dilation of grains can cause additional stress in the grains 
which can stabilise or destabilise the soil. The flow is thus controlled by the 
coupling between the dilatancy of the granular layer and the development of 
pore pressure in the fluid phase~\citep{Pailha2008}. The dense column needs to 
dilate in order to flow. When it starts to fall, liquid is then sucked into the 
column, which is then stabilised by the additional viscous 
drag~\citep{Rondon2011,Topin2012}. By opposition the loose column when 
it starts flowing expands and ejects liquid, leading to a partial fluidisation 
of the material.

\section{Submarine granular flows down inclined planes}

Slope failure is a problem of high practical importance for both civil 
engineering structures and natural hazards management. Catastrophic events such 
as landslides, debris flows, rock avalanches or reservoir embankment failures 
exemplify the potential consequences of a soil gravitational instability. One 
of the most critical situation concerns a submerged sandy slope as pore 
pressure changes; seepage or earthquakes can cause significant damages to 
off-shore structures and may generate a tsunami.

The influence of slope angle on the effect of permeability and the initial 
packing density on the run-out behaviour are studied. In this study, a 2D 
poly-disperse system ($d_{max}/d_{min} = 2$) of circular discs forming a 
granular column in fluid is used to understand the behaviour of granular flows 
down inclined planes (\cref{fig:LBM_Scheme_geometry}). The soil column is 
modelled using $\sim 1000$ to $2000$ discs of density 
\SI{2650}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} and a contact friction angle of 
\SI{26}{\degree}. The collapse of the granular column is simulated inside a 
fluid with a density of \SI{1000}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} and a kinematic 
viscosity of \SI{1e-6}{\square\meter\per\second}. A granular column with 
an initial aspect ratio \textit{a} of 0.8 is used. A hydrodynamic radius 
\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R} is adopted during the LBM computations. Dry 
analyses are also performed to study the effect of hydrodynamic forces on the 
run-out distance. The numerical configuration used in this study is shown 
in~\cref{fig:geometry}. The slope angle $\theta$ is varied as \SI{0}{\degree}, 
\SI{2.5}{\degree}, \SI{5}{\degree}, and \SI{7.5}{\degree}. The influence of 
permeability (with hydrodynamic radius varied as 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85 and 0.9 
\textit{R}) on the run-out behaviour of collapse of granular columns on to an 
inclined plane with a slope angle of 5\si{\degree} is also analysed. 


\subsection{Effect of initial density}
In order to understand the influence of the initial packing density on the 
run-out behaviour, a dense sand column (initial packing density, $\eta_h=83\%$) 
and a loose sand column ($\eta_h=79\%$) are considered. The granular columns 
collapse and flow down slopes of varying inclinations. The run-out behaviour is 
compared with the collapse of a granular column in fluid on a horizontal 
surface. For all slope angles, the flow kinematics in the submerged condition 
is compared with its dry counterpart to understand the influence of lubrication 
and viscous drag. A hydrodynamic radius of \textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R} is 
adopted in all cases, because low permeability conditions result in longer 
run-out distance as observed in the previous section.


The evolution of the normalised run-out with time for the collapse of a dense 
sand column in dry and submerged conditions for varying slope inclinations is 
presented in~\cref{fig:run_dense}. For all slope angles, the run-out distances 
in the dry condition are longer than those observed in the submerged condition. 
Similar to the case of collapse on a horizontal plane, the dense granular 
columns experience drag forces that have a significant influence than the 
lubrication effect. The difference in the run-out between the dry and the 
submerged condition decreases with increase in the slope angle. At a slope 
angle of 5\si{\degree} the difference in the run-out between 
the dry and the submerged condition is the smallest. This is due to 
hydroplaning of a thin flowing layer, the occurrence of hydroplaning can be 
observed by a sustained peak kinetic energy (\cref{fig:KE_dense}). At 
higher slope angles (> 5\si{\degree}), the drag force predominates over the 
lubrication effect and results in significantly shorter run-out distance than 
the dry condition. This can be observed by the difference in the kinetic energy 
evolution between the dry and the submerged conditions.

\caption{Evolution of run-out and kinetic energy with time (dense condition).}
\label{fig:run_KE_dense}
\end{figure}

Similar to the case of collapse on a horizontal surface, the dense granular 
columns in fluid require a longer time to collapse and flow, due to the 
development of large negative pore-pressures. Large negative pore-pressures are 
developed as the dense granular material dilates due to shearing along the 
shear-failure surface in the initial phase of the flow. The snapshots of the 
dense granular column collapse down slopes of varying inclinations at the time 
($t=\tau_{c}=3\sqrt{H/g}$), are shown in~\cref{fig:slope_dense}. It can be 
observed that the amount of water entrainment increases with increase in slope 
angle. At a slope of 7.5\si{\degree}, a layer of entrained water (thickness 
$\sim 2d$) along the bottom of the flow front can be observed. However, with 
increase in slope angle, the surface area of granular mass experiencing the 
hydrodynamic drag increases, which results in a shorter run-out distance than 
the dry condition.

\Cref{fig:KE_dense} shows the evolution of normalised kinetic energy 
with time for dry and submerged collapse on different slope angles. It can be 
seen that the viscous drag on the dense column tends to be more dominant than 
influence of hydroplaning on the run-out behaviour. This influence can be 
observed in the smaller peak kinetic energy 
for the submerged granular material in comparison to the dry condition. With 
increasing slope angle, the volume of material that dilates increases. 
This results in large negative pore-pressures and more viscous drag on the 
granular material. Hence, the difference in the run-out between the dry and the 
submerged 
conditions, for a dense granular assembly, increases with increase in the slope 
angle above an inclination of 5\si{\degree}.

In contrast to the dense granular columns, the loose granular columns (packing 
fraction of 79\%) show longer run-out distance in immersed conditions 
(\cref{fig:run_loose}). The snapshots at $t = 3\tau_c$ of a loose granular 
column (a = 0.8) collapse down slopes inclined at an angle of 2.5\si{\degree}, 
5\si{\degree} and 7.5\si{\degree} are presented in~\cref{fig:slope_loose} The 
run-out distance in fluid increases with increase in the slope angle in 
comparison to the dry cases. The loose granular flow tends to entrain more 
water at the base of the flow front, creating a lubricating surface, which 
results in a longer run-out distance. For the same thickness of the flow, 
the loose granular flow has a smaller density and hence a higher Froude's 
number than the dense flow resulting in a higher probability of hydroplaning. 
The hydroplaning effect causes an increase in the flow velocity for the loose 
granular material in comparison with the dense condition 
(\cref{fig:KE_loose}).

angles(loose condition).}

\end{figure}

In contrast to dense granular flows, loose granular flows exhibit a plug-like 
flow (\cref{fig:run_loose}). Due to the low permeability, the 
water entrapped in the flow front results in a drop in the density of the 
flowing mass, which causes lower effective stress thus enabling lubrication. 
The turbulence effect observed on the surface of the dense granular flow is 
absent in the loose granular collapse. This, along with the lubrication effect, 
results in a longer run-out distance in the submerged condition for a loose 
granular column than the dry collapse.

The evolution of packing density for dry and loose collapse in fluid for 
different slope angles (\cref{fig:voro}) shows that, at the end 
of the flow, both the dense and the loose conditions reach a similar packing 
density. The dense granular column dilates more, which results in large 
negative pore-pressure that is to be dissipated so as the granular mass is able 
to flow. Whereas in the loose condition, a positive pore-pressure is observed 
at the base of the flow, indicating entrainment of 
water at the base, i.e. lubrication and drop in the effective stress resulting 
in a longer run-out distance. The amount of water entrained in the loose 
granular column is higher than the dense condition, this can be observed by the 
low packing fraction observed between $2\tau_c$ and $5 \tau_c$. The evolution 
of Froude's number with time for dense and loose conditions are shown 
in~\cref{fig:Fr_a08_dense}. Loose granular columns have Froude's number greater 
than 0.4, which indicates occurrence of hydroplaning. For a given slope angle 
and aspect ratio the Froude's number observed in loose granular columns is 
significantly higher than that observed in dense granular columns. This shows 
that the flow behaviour in a loose column is controlled by lubrication / 
hydroplaning, while the dense granular column experience higher drag forces.

\Cref{fig:slope_runout_dense} shows the evolution of run-out with slope angle 
for an initially dense granular column. As the slope angle increases, the 
run-out increases in both dry and submerged conditions. For all slope angles, 
the run-out in the dry condition is higher than the submerged conditions. As 
the slope angle increases, the drag force experienced by the dense granular 
column is more dominant than lubrication effect on the run-out behaviour, this 
results in an increase in the difference between the dry and the submerged 
conditions with increase in the slope angle. Whereas with an increase in the 
slope angle, the loose granular column flows longer than the dry conditions. 
The longer run-out in the loose granular column collapse is due to hydroplaning 
experienced at the flow front as a result of entrainment of 
water.~\Cref{fig:slope_runout} shows that for a 
given initial aspect ratio and slope angle, the run-out distance in the loose 
granular collapse in fluid is higher than the dense condition. This observation 
in fluid is in contrast to the dry condition, where the dense granular column 
flows longer due to higher initial potential energy. A loose granular flow with 
low permeability ensures that water entrained at the base of the flow front is 
retained resulting in sustained lubrication effect. Also, the low permeability 
ensures that the density of the flowing mass remains in a slurry state 
resulting in a longer duration of hydroplaning. These effects in the loose 
granular column with low permeability condition result in a longer run-out 
distance.

\subsection{Effect of permeability}

In order to understand the effect of permeability on granular flow down a slope 
angle of \SI{5}{\degree}, the collapse of a granular column with an initial 
aspect ratio of 0.8 is simulated with different permeabilities. The 
hydrodynamic radius of a loosely packed granular column is varied from 
\textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R} (high permeability), 0.75 \textit{R}, 0.8 
\textit{R}, 0.85 \textit{R} to 0.9 \textit{R} (low permeability). The run-out 
distance is found to increase with decreasing permeability of the granular 
assembly (\cref{fig:run5}). The run-out distance for high permeability 
conditions (\textit{r} = 0.7 \textit{R} -- 0.8 \textit{R}) are lower than their 
dry counterparts. Although, a decrease in permeability resulted in an increase 
in the run-out distance, no significant change in the run-out behaviour is 
observed for a hydrodynamic radii of up to 0.8 \textit{R}.

With a further decrease in permeability (\textit{r} = 0.85 \textit{R} and 0.9 
\textit{R}), the run-out 
distance in the fluid is longer than that observed in the dry 
condition. At a very low permeability (\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R}), the 
flowing granular mass
entrains more water at the base, which causes a reduction in the effective 
stress accompanied by a lubrication effect. This can be seen by a significant 
increase in the peak kinetic energy and the sustained duration of the peak 
energy, in comparison to the dry and the highly permeable conditions 
(\cref{fig:KE5}). However, the permeability of the granular column did not have 
an influence on the evolution of height during the flow. But, the dry granular 
column tends to collapse more than the immersed granular column due to the lack 
of viscous dissipation (\cref{fig:height5}).

Positive pore-pressure generation at the base of the flow is observed for low 
permeability conditions. Inspection of the local packing density showed 
entrainment of water at the base of the flow, which can also be observed by the 
steep decrease in the packing density (\cref{fig:voro5}) for the very low 
permeability condition (\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R}). At the end of the flow 
($t \ge 10 \times \tau_c$), the excess pore-pressure dissipates and the 
granular flows, irrespective of their permeability, reach almost the same 
packing density.


\Cref{fig:Perm_Runout_loose_dense} shows the effect of permeability on the 
run-out behaviour for a dense and a loose granular column collapse on a slope 
of 5\si{\degree} and 0\si{\degree}. In both cases, the run-out distance 
increases with increase in the hydrodynamic radius (decrease in permeability). 
However in the dense case, the run-out distance observed in the fluid is 
shorter than the dry condition. Whereas in the loose condition, the run-out 
distance increases significantly at low permeabilities and results in a longer 
run-out distance in the submerged condition in comparison to the dry granular 
collapse. The comparison of loose and dense collapse on slopes of 
0\si{\degree} and 5\si{\degree} shows that the initial packing density plays a 
significant role in the case of collapse on a horizontal plane, however at a 
slope of 5\si{\degree}, the run-out distance is unaffected by the initial 
packing density at high permeability conditions. This shows that at high 
permeabilities, the viscous drag forces predominate resulting in almost the 
same run-out distance for both dense and loose conditions. However at a low 
permeability (\textit{r} = 0.9 \textit{R}), hydroplaning is observed in the 
case of loose 
granular column resulting in a substantially longer run-out distance than the 
dense granular column in submerged condition.

\section{Tall columns}

In the case of tall columns, the amount of material destabilised above the 
failure plane is larger than that of short columns. Hence in tall columns, 
the surface area of the mobilised mass that interacts with the 
surrounding fluid is significantly higher than the short columns. This 
increase in the area of soil - fluid interaction results in an increase
in the formation of turbulent vortices that alter the deposit morphology during 
the collapse. It is observed that the vortices result in formation of heaps 
that significantly affect the distribution of mass in the flow 
(\cref{sec:collapse_fluid_evolution}) .~\citet{Staron2007a} observed that the 
distribution of mass in a granular flow plays a crucial role in the flow 
kinematics. In order to understand the behaviour of tall columns, the run-out 
behaviour of a dense granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 6 is 
studied. The collapse of a tall granular column on slopes of 0\si{\degree}, 
2.5\si{\degree}, 5\si{\degree} and 7.5\si{\degree} are studied. A hydrodynamic 
radius of \textit{r} = 0.85 \textit{R} is adopted. 

Snapshots of the collapse of an aspect ratio 6 column in fluid on a horizontal 
surface are shown in~\cref{fig:LBM_DEM_a6}. The initial stage of collapse is 
characterised by the free-fall of grains above the failure surface. Unlike the 
dry condition, as the grains undergo free-fall due to gravity, they interact 
with the surrounding fluid experiencing drag forces. This results in a 
significant drop in the kinetic energy available for the flow. As the grains 
reach the static region, they interact with the neighbouring grains and the 
kinetic energy gained during the free fall is converted into horizontal 
acceleration. Uniquely during this stage ($t = 3\tau_c$) the interactions 
between the soil grains on the surface with the surrounding fluid result in the 
formation of eddies. The number of eddies formed during the flow is 
proportional to the surface area of the granular mass interacting with the 
fluid. Hydroplaning can be observed at the flow front ($t = 3\tau_c$). Two 
large vortices with almost the same size can be observed at the final stage of 
collapse. The soil grains on the surface experience suction due to formation of 
eddies and this results in formation of heaps of granular mass in front of each 
vortex. The formation of heaps, although in evidence, doesn't significantly 
affect the distribution of mass in the case of collapse on a horizontal plane. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{LBM_DEM_a6}
\caption{Flow evolution of a granular column collapse in fluid (a = 6) on a 
horizontal surface.}
\label{fig:LBM_DEM_a6}
\end{figure}


Snapshots of the collapse of a granular column (\textit{a} = 6) on a inclined 
plane at angle of 5\si{\degree} are shown in~\cref{fig:a6_slope_snapshots}. 
The collapse on a slope of 5\si{\degree} show flow evolution behaviour similar 
to the case of collapse on a horizontal plane. The vortices are formed only 
during the horizontal spreading stage $t = 3\tau_c$, but the number of vortices 
formed during the collapse is higher than the collapse on a horizontal plane. 
However, as the flow progresses a single large vortex engulfs other smaller 
vortices, thus having a significant influence on the mass 
distribution.~\Cref{fig:a6_slope_voro} shows 
the distribution of mass and the packing density at $t = 6\tau_c$ and $t = 
8\tau_c$. A heap can be observed in front of the large vortex almost at the 
middle of the flow. The height of the heap formed in the middle of the granular 
flow is higher than the collapse height next to the wall. However, when the 
flow comes to rest and the vortex moves 
away from the flowing surface, the mass present in the heap gets redistributed 
(as seen at $t = 8\tau_c$). This behaviour is significantly different from that 
observed in the case of short columns.

In order to understand the influence of slope angles on the run-out behaviour, 
the collapse of a granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 6 is 
performed on slopes of 0\si{\degree}, 2.5\si{\degree}, 5\si{\degree} and 
7.5\si{\degree}. The run-out evolution with time for different slope angles are 
presented in~\cref{fig:Runout_a6_slope}. The run-out distance increases with 
increase in the slope angle, however the run-out distance in the fluid is 
significantly shorter than the dry condition. The slow evolution of run-out in 
the submerged condition is due to the delay in the dissipation of large 
negative pore-pressures developed during the initial stage of the collapse. The 
formation of eddies during the flow indicates that most of the potential energy 
gained during the free-fall is dissipated through viscous drag and turbulence. 
This effect predominates over the hydroplaning that is observed during 
the flow resulting in a shorter run-out distance in the case of fluid. The 
evolution of the normalised height with time (\cref{fig:Height_a6_slope}) for 
collapse on different slope angles indicates that the 
amount of material destabilised in fluid is less than the dry conditions due to 
the drag forces experienced by the grains, which retards the quantity and the 
rate of collapse.

\Cref{fig:KE_a6_slope} shows the evolution of the normalised kinetic energy 
for a granular column (a = 6) collapse in fluid on different slope angles. The 
amount of kinetic energy available for the flow in the submerged condition 
is almost half that of the dry condition. It can be seen from the figure that 
the vertical kinetic energy in the fluid condition dissipates a longer 
duration, in contrast to the free-fall release observed in the dry condition. 
The slower dissipation is attributed to the viscous drag force experienced by 
the grains.

The behaviour of tall columns is significantly different from that observed in 
the case of short columns. The slope angle has a strong influence on the number 
and size of eddies during the flow. The eddies interact with the surface of the 
granular flow and forms heaps in front of each vortex. This significantly 
affects the mass distribution and in turn the run-out evolution. Although tall 
cliffs are quite rare in submarine condition in comparison to short cliffs or 
slopes, further research is required to understand the influence of 
permeability and packing density on the run-out evolution of tall columns.

\section{Summary}

Two-dimensional LB-DEM simulations are performed to understand the behaviour 
of submarine granular flows. Unlike dry granular collapse, the run-out 
behaviour in fluid is dictated by the initial volume fraction. Although 
previous studies have shown the influence of initial packing density on the 
run-out behaviour, a precise understanding of density, permeability and 
presence of fluid on the run-out behaviour was lacking. The following 
conclusion are derived based on this study:

\begin{itemize}

\item For dense columns, at all aspect ratios, the run-out in 
the dry case is significantly higher than the submerged condition.

\item Granular columns with loose packing and low permeability tend to flow 
farther in comparison to dense columns and dry conditions, due to entrainment 
of water at the base of the flow front resulting in lubrication and/or 
hydroplaning.

\item For the same thickness and velocity of the flow, the potential of 
hydroplaning is influenced by the density of the flowing mass. Loose columns 
are more likely to hydroplane than the dense granular masses, as they entrain 
more water at the flow front, leading to partial fluidisation. 

\item In both dense and loose conditions, the run-out distance increases 
with decreasing permeability. An increase in the hydrodynamic radius from 
0.7 to 0.95 \textit{R} increases the normalised run-out by 25\%. 

\item For the same value of peak kinetic energy, the run-out distance in fluid 
is longer than the dry column collapse. Also, with decreasing permeability the 
run-out distance increases for the same peak kinetic energy. 

\item The low permeability of the granular mass results in entrainment of water 
causing hydroplaning. At higher aspect ratios, a decrease in permeability does 
not have a significant influence on the run-out behaviour, due to the turbulent 
nature of collapse of tall columns.

\item With decreasing permeability, the duration for the flow to 
initiate increases as the time required to dissipate the large negative 
pore-pressures increases. 

\item The number of vortices formed during a collapse in fluid is found to be 
proportional to the amount of material destabilised. The vortices are formed 
only during the spreading stage of collapse.

\item The formation of eddies during the collapse of tall columns indicates 
that most of the potential energy gained during the free-fall is dissipated 
through viscous drag and turbulence. 


\item For dense granular columns at various slope angles, the run-out in the 
dry condition is higher than for submerged conditions. Whereas with increasing 
slope angle, the loose granular column flows farther than the dry conditions. 

\item The initial packing density plays a significant role in the case of 
collapse on a horizontal plane, however at slope greater than 5\si{\degree}, 
the run-out distance is unaffected by the initial packing density at high 
permeability conditions. 

\item At high permeabilities, the viscous drag forces predominate for both 
dense and loose conditions. However at a low permeability (\textit{r} = 0.9 
\textit{R}), 
hydroplaning is observed in the case of loose condition. 

\item The behaviour of tall columns is significantly different from that 
observed in the case of short columns. The slope angle has a strong influence 
on the number and size of eddies during the flow. The eddies interact with the 
surface of the granular flow and forms heaps in front of each vortex. This 
significantly affects the mass distribution and in turn the run-out evolution 
of tall columns. 

\end{itemize}
