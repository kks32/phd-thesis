\section{Introduction}
Avalanches, landslides, and debris flows are geophysical hazards, which involve 
rapid mass movement of granular solids, water, and air as a single phase 
system. Globally, landslides 
cause billions of pounds in damage, and thousands of deaths and injuries each 
year. Hence, it is important to understand the triggering mechanism and the flow
evolution. The momentum transfer between the discrete and continuous 
phases significantly affects the dynamics of the flow as a 
whole~\citep{Topin2012}. Although certain macroscopic models are able to 
capture simple mechanical 
behaviours~\citep{Peker2007}, the complex physical mechanisms occurring at the 
grain scale, such as hydrodynamic instabilities, formation of clusters, 
collapse, and transport,~\citep{Topin2011} have largely been ignored. In 
particular, when the solid phase reaches a high volume fraction, the strong 
heterogeneity arising from the contact forces between the grains, and the 
hydrodynamic forces, are difficult to integrate into the homogenization process 
involving global averages. 

In order to describe the mechanism of immersed 
granular flows, it is important to consider both the dynamics of the solid 
phase and the role of the ambient fluid~\citep{Denlinger2001}. The dynamics of 
the solid phase alone is insufficient to describe the mechanism of granular 
flow in a fluid. It is important to consider the effect of hydrodynamic forces 
that reduce the weight of the solids inducing a transition from dense-compacted 
to dense-suspended flows, and the drag interactions which counteract the 
movement of the solids~\citep{Meruane2010}. Transient regimes characterized by 
change in the solid fraction, dilation at the onset of flow and development of 
excess pore pressure, result in altering the balance between the stress carried 
by the fluid and that carried by the grains, thereby changing the overall 
behaviour of the flow. 


The presence of a fluid phase in a granular medium has profound effects on its 
mechanical behaviour. In dry granular media the rheology is governed by grain 
inertia and static stresses sustained by the contact network depending on the 
shear-rate and confining pressure, respectively~\citep{Midi2004}. As the fluid 
inertia and viscosity come into play, complications arise as a result of 
contradictory effects. On one hand, the fluid may delay the onset of
granular flow or prevent the dispersion of the grains by
developing negative pore pressures~\citep{Pailha2008,Topin2011}. On the other
hand, the fluid lubricates the contacts between grains, enhancing in this way 
the granular flow, and it has a retarding effect at the same time by inducing 
drag forces on the grains. The objective of the present study is to understand 
the differences in the mechanism of flow initiation and kinematics between dry 
and submerged granular flow. In the present study, 2D Lattice-Boltzmann and 
Discrete Element Method is used to model the fluid-soil interactions in  
underwater granular flows.  The choice of a 2D geometry has the advantage of 
cheaper computational effort than a 3D case, making it feasible to 
simulate very large systems. 



\section{LBM-DEM Permeability}

In a 3D granular assembly, the pore spaces between grains are 
interconnected, whereas in a 2-D assembly, a non-interconnected pore-fluid 
space is formed as the grains are in contact with each 
other. Which means that the pore-fluid enclosed between the grains cannot flow 
to neighbouring pore-spaces.  This results in a unnatural no flow condition in 
a 2-D case (see~\cref{fig:reduction}). In order to overcome this difficulty, a 
reduction in radius is assumed only during LBM computations (fluid and fluid – 
solid interaction). The reduced radius of the soil grain, i.e., the 
\textit{hydrodynamic radius} `r', allows for interconnected pore space through 
which the pore-fluid can flow similar to 3D behaviour. The reduction in radius 
is assumed only during LBM computations, hence this technique has no effect on 
the grain – grain interactions computed using DEM. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{reduction}
\caption{Schematic representation of the hydrodynamic radius in LBM-DEM 
computation}
\label{fig:reduction}
\end{figure}

Realistically, the hydrodynamic radius can be varied from $ r = 0.7 R$ to 
$0.95R$, where ‘R’ is the grain radius. Different permeability can be 
obtained, for any given initial packing, by varying the hydrodynamic radius of 
the grains, without changing the actual granular packing. Hence, the 
hydrodynamic radius represents the permeability of the granular assembly. In 
another sense, the hydrodynamic radius can be assumed to represent the 
irregularities on the granular surface. Reducing the hydrodynamic radius 
represents wider channel and more flow between the grains. 

In order to understand the relation between the hydrodynamic radius and the 
permeability of the granular assembly, horizontal permeability tests are 
performed by varying the hydrodynamic radius as 0.7R, 0.75R, 0.8R, 0.85R, 0.9 
and 0.95R. The transverse permeability of a square sample of $50~\si{\mm} 
\times 50~\si{\mm}$ filled with poly-disperse ($d_{max}/d_{min} = 1.8$) grains 
with a mean diameter of 1.7\si{\mm} is determined. Dirichlet boundary condition 
(discussed in~\cref{sec:lbm_bc}), i.e.,  pressure/density constrain is applied 
along the left and the right boundaries. The density on the left boundary is 
increased in small increments ($10^{-4} \Delta P$), which a constant density is 
maintained on the right boundary. This results in a pressure gradient causing 
the fluid to flow (see~\cref{fig:perm}).

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Evaluation of the horizontal permeability for a 
	hydrodynamic radius of 0.7R.}
	\label{fig:perm}
\end{figure}


The mean velocity of flow (v) 
is determined and the permeability of the sample (k) is computed as:
%
\begin{equation}
k=v\cdot\mu\cdot\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta P} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (\si{\Pa\s}), $\Delta x$ is 
the thickness of the bed of porous medium \si{\m}, and $\Delta P$ is the 
applied pressure difference \si{\Pa}. For a given hydrodynamic radius, the 
pressure gradient $\Delta P$ is varied to obtain different flow rates. Probing 
the fluid space showed a Poiseuille flow behaviour between grains. The flow is 
still within the Darcy's laminar flow regime, which is verified by the linear 
slope between the pressure gradient and mean flow velocity 
(see~\cref{fig:permeability}). It can be observed that with increase in the 
hydrodynamic radius the permeability decreases, i.e., the slope of the mean 
flow velocity 
to the pressure gradient decreases. At very low pressure gradient ($\Delta P 
\le 0.1$), both 0.9R and 0.95r has a no flow condition. A hydrodynamic radius 
of $r = 0.95R$ shows almost no flow behaviour, even at higher pressure 
gradients. A high value of hydrodynamic radius $r > 0.95R$ 
results in unnatural flow behaviour. Hence, hydrodynamic radii in the range of 
0.7 to 0.95R are adopted in the present study.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Permeability}
\caption{Variation of the mean flow velocity with pressure gradient for 
different hydrodynamic radius.}
\label{fig:permeability}
\end{figure}


Increase in the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 to 0.95 reduces the porosity from 
0.60 to 0.27. The permeability computed from LB – DEM method is verified by 
comparing it with the analytical solution. One of the widely used analytical 
solution for permeability is the Carman – Kozeny equation (CK Model), 
which is based on the Poiseuille flow through a pipe and is mainly used for 3D, 
homogeneous, isotropic, granular porous media at moderate porosities. In the 
present study, a modified Carman – Kozeny equation that takes into account the 
micro-structure of the fibres and that is valid in a wide range of porosities 
is adopted~\citep{Yazdchi2011}. The normalized permeability is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{k}{d^2} = \frac{\epsilon}{\psi_{CK}(1-\epsilon)^2} \,.
\end{equation}
%
In the CK model, the hydraulic diameter $D_h$ , is expressed as a function of 
measurable quantities: porosity and specific surface area
%
\begin{align}
D_h & = \frac{4\epsilon V}{S_v}=\frac{\epsilon d}{(1 - \epsilon)} \,, \\
a_v & = \frac{\mbox{grain surface}}{\mbox{grain volume}} = 
\frac{S_v}{(1-\epsilon V)} = \frac{4}{d} \,,
\end{align}
%
where $S_v$ is the total wetted surface, and $a_v$ is the specific surface 
area. The above value of $a_v$ is for circles (cylinders) - for spheres $a_v = 
6/d$. $\psi_{CK}$ is the empirically  measured CK factor, which represents both 
the shape factor and the deviation of flow direction from that in a duct. It is 
approximated for randomly packed beds of spherical grains. The normalized 
permeability for different porosity obtained by varying the radius from 0.7 to 
0.95 is presented in~\cref{fig:Carman}. The normalized permeability is found to 
match the qualitative trend of the Carman-Kozeny equations. The LB – DEM 
permeability curve lies between the permeability curves for spherical and 
cylindrical grain arrangements implying a better approximation of 
three-dimensional permeability using a 2D granular assembly with a reduced 
grain radius during LBM computations. Thus using hydrodynamic radius, realistic 
fluid - grain interactions can be obtained in a 2D geometry.

\section{Granular collapse in fluid}

The collapse of a granular column, which mimics the
collapse of a cliff, has been extensively studied in the case of
dry granular material, when the interstitial fluid plays no
role (see~\cref{sec:dry_granular_column}). The problem of the granular collapse 
in a liquid,which is of importance for submarine landslides, has to our
knowledge attracted less attention~\citep{Rondon2011}.~\citet{Thompson2007} 
observed that the presence of liquid dramatically changes the way a granular 
column collapses compared to the dry case. The destabilization of a granular 
pile strongly depends on the initial volume fraction of the packing. For dense 
packings the granular flow is localized at the free surface of the pile, 
whereas for loose packings the destabilization occurs in the bulk of the
material and has a parabolic profile~\citep{Bonnet2010,Topin2011,Iverson2000}. 

\subsection{LBM-DEM set-up}

In the present study, the collapse of a granular column in fluid is studied 
using 2D LBM - DEM. The effect of initial aspect on the run-out behaviour is 
investigated. The flow kinematics are compared with the dry and buoyant 
granular collapse to understand the influence of hydrodynamic forces and 
lubrication on the run-out. Unlike dry column, the role of permeability and the 
initial volume fraction is expected to have a significant influence on the flow 
dynamics. Hence the effect of permeability and the initial packing density on 
the run-out behaviour is investigated.

The granular collapse set-up in fluid is very similar to the dry granular 
column collapse. A rectangular channel of length $L_0$ and height $H_0$ is 
filled with poly-dispersed discs having ($d_{max}/d_{min} = 1.8$) 
(see~\Cref{fig:geometry}). The granular column is then placed in a fluid with a 
density of \SI{1000}{\kg\per\cubic\meter}  and a kinematic viscosity of 
\SI{1e-6}{\square\meter\per\second}. The gate supporting the right-hand side 
boundary of the granular column is opened allowing the column to collapse and 
flow in fluid. The final run-out distance is measured as $L_f$ and 
final collapse height as $H_f$. The collapse takes place on a horizontal 
surface. The initial aspect ratio of the column is varied as 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 
0.8, 1, 2, 4 and 6. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.97\columnwidth]{geometry}
\caption{Underwater granular collapse set-up.}
\label{fig:geometry}
\end{figure}

The cumulative $\beta$ distribution is adopted to generate grains with 
$d_{max}$ and $d_{min}$ as 1.25~\si{\mm} and 2.2~\si{\mm}, respectively. The 
soil column is modelled using $\approx 2000$ discs of density 
\SI{2650}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} and a contact friction angle of 
\SI{26}{\degree}. A linear-elastic contact model is used in the
DEM simulations. The granular assemble has a packing fraction of $83\%$. The 
critical time step for DEM is computed based on the local 
contact natural frequency and damping ratio. A sub-cycling time integration is 
adopted in DEM (see~\cref{sec:coupled_lbm_dem}). A fluid flow (LBM) time step, 
$\Delta t = 2.0E^-5s$ is determined based on the viscosity and relaxation 
parameter $\tau = 0.506$. An integer ratio $n_s$, between the fluid flow time 
step $\Delta t$ and DEM time step $\Delta t_D$ is determined as 15, i.e., every 
LBM iteration involves a sub-cycle of 15 DEM iterations.

In order to capture realistic physical behaviour of the fluid – grain system, 
it is essential to model the boundary condition between the fluid and the grain 
as a non-slip boundary condition, i.e. the fluid near the grain should have 
similar velocity as the grain boundary. The solid grains inside the fluid are 
represented by lattice nodes. The discrete nature of lattice, results in a 
stepwise representation of the surfaces (see~\cref{fig:LBM-DEM}), which are 
otherwise circular, hence sufficiently small lattice spacing $h$ is required. 
The smallest DEM grain in the system controls the size of the lattice. In the 
present study, a very fine discretisation of $d_{min}/h = 10$ is adopted, 
i.e., the smallest grain with a diameter $d_min$ in the system is discretised 
into 100 lattice nodes ($ 10h \times 10h$). This provides a very accurate 
representation of the interaction between the solid and the fluid nodes.  A 
hydrodynamic radius of 0.7R is adopted during LBM computations.

representation of circular disks in the lattice.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Collapse in fluid: Flow evolution}
Two-dimensional plane-strain LBM-DEM simulations of granular column 
collapse are performed by varying the initial aspect ratio of the column from 
0.2 to 6. The normalized final run-out distance is computed as $\Delta L = 
(L_{\textit{f}}-L_{\textit{0}})/L_{\textit{0}}$. Similar to dry granular 
collapse, the duration of collapse is normalised with a criticial time $\tau_c 
= \sqrt{H/g}$. Where, $H$ is the initial height of the granular column and g is 
the acceleration due to gravity.  Dry and buoyant analyses of granular column 
collapse are also performed to understand the effect of hydrodynamic forces on 
the run-out distance.

Snapshots of flow evolution of a granular column collapse with an initial 
aspect ratio of 0.4 is shown in~\cref{fig:a04_snapshots}. The failure begins at 
the toe end of the column, and the fracture surface propagates into the column 
at an angle of about $50\si{\degree}$, similar to dry column. For the short 
column, the failure is due to collapse of the flanks. Once the material is 
destabilisied, the granular mass interacts with the surrounding fluid resulting 
in formation of turbulent vortices. These vortices interact with the grains at 
the surface, resulting in irregularities on the free surface. Force chains can 
be observed in the static region of collapse, which indicates the flow can be 
described using a continuum theory. As the granular material ceases to flow, 
force chains develop at the flow front, revealing consolidation of the granular 
mass resulting in increase in strength.

the velocity profile of fluid due to interaction with the grains (red - higher 
velocity).}
\label{fig:a04_snapshots}
\end{figure}


The evolution of run-out with time for a short column (a = 0.4) is presented 
in~\cref{fig:Runout_a04f}. The dry column exhibits longer run-out distance in 
comparison to the submerged column. The collapse of a dry column using DEM 
represents a collapse in vacuum, without any influence of drag forces or 
viscosity of air. A LBM-DEM simulation of a granular column collapse using the 
kinematic viscosity of air is performed to compare the dry column with the 
collapse in air. It can be observed that both the ``dry'' condition and the 
collapse in air show almost the same run-out behaviour. However, the collapse 
in fluid (water) results in a much shorter run-out distance. The granular mass 
in fluid has the buoyant mass, in contrast to the dry density. A dry granular 
collapse with the buoyant unit weight is performed to understand the effect of 
buoyancy on the run-out behaviour. The dry column with buoyant unit weight also 
exhibits longer run-out behaviour than the collapse in fluid. However, due to 
decrease in the initial potential energy, the run-out observed in the buoyant 
condition is shorter than the dry condition. The column collapse in fluid takes 
longer to evolve when submerged in water, which might be due to the development 
of large negative porewater pressure that is generated during the shear failure 
along the fracture surface. The large negative pore pressure has to be 
dissipated before the granular mass above the fracture surface can collapse and 
flow. The shorter run-out distance in the fluid case, in comparison with the 
dry and buoyant conditions, shows that the collapse in fluid is significantly 
affected by the hydrodynamic drag force acting on the soil grains. The 
evolution of height $H/L$ is presented in~\cref{}. Since the failure of the 
column is only at the flank, the central static region remains unaffected. 
Hence, the final height of the column is the same in dry and submerged 
conditions.

\end{figure}

The evolution of normalised kinetic energy with time for a column with an 
initial aspect ratio of 0.4 is shown in~\cref{fig:a04f_energy}. It can be 
observed that the peak kinetic energy is attained later in the submerged 
condition than the dry collapse. This can be attributed to the time required to 
overcome the negative pore pressure generated during the shear along the 
fracture surface. For short columns the critical time $\tau_c$ is controlled by 
the vertical kinetic energy. The amount of kinetic energy in submerged case is 
significanlty lower than the dry condition. Also, the potential energy 
evolution (see~\cref{fig:PE_a04f}) shows a significant influence of the 
hydrodynamic forces on the amount of material destabilised during the collapse. 
The drag forces reduces and slows down the amount of material that undergo 
collapse resulting in shorter run-out distance for short columns.

Snapshots of the flow evolution of a granular column collapse with an initial 
aspect ratio of 4 is shown in~\cref{fig:a4_snapshots}. For a tall column, the 
collapse mechanism changes. The entire column is involved in the collapse. The 
height of the static region, which is below the fracture surface, is shorter 
than the total height of the column. This results in a free-fall of grains 
above the fracture surface. As the grains experience free-fall they interact 
with the surrounding fluid. However, no vortices are observed during the 
initial stage of collapse. In the second phase, when the grains reach the base, 
the vertical acceleration gained during the free-fall is converted to 
horizontal kinetic energy. As the grains are ejected horizontally, the free 
surface of the granular mass interacts with the fluid resulting in formation of 
the turbulent vortices. Unlike short columns, these vortices have significant 
influence on the mass distribution along the run-out. Heaps of granular 
material can be observed in front of each vortices. The number of vortices 
formed during a collapse is found to be proportional to the amount of material 
destabilised, i.e., the length of free-surface interacting with the fluid 
influences the number of vortices generated during the collapse. The 
reappearance of force chains at $t = 6\tau_c$ $\& 8\tau_c$ indicates the 
granular mass is consolidating resulting in an increase in the shear strength.

The time evolution of the run-out and height of a tall column (a=4) is 
presented in~\cref{fig:Runout_a4f} and~\cref{fig:Height_a4f}, respectively. 
Similar to the short column, the run-out observed in the dry condition is much 
longer than that observed in submerged condition. Also, the evolution of 
run-out is slower in case of submerged condition, which indicates the influence 
drag force on the run-out evolution. The height of the column is significantly 
affected by the hydrodynamic forces (see~\cref{fig:Height_a4f,fig:PE_a4f}), 
which reduces the amount of material destabilised 
during collapse.

The evolution of kinetic energies with time for aspect ratio 4 is presented 
in~\cref{fig:a4f_energy}. Even during the free-fall stage, the peak vertical 
energy is delayed in the case of fluid, which shows the influence of the 
viscosity on the flow evolution. Almost half of the kinetic energy that is 
available in the case of dry granular collapse is dissipated due to the drag 
force experienced by the grains. This shows that the influence of viscous drag 
on the run-out evolution is significantly higher than the effect of lubrication.

The initial aspect ratio of the column is varied from 0.2 to 6. The final 
run-out distance as a function of the initial aspect ratio of the columnt is 
presented in~\cref{fig:runoutf}. For all aspect ratios, the run-out observed in 
the dry case is significantly higher than the submerged condition. For short 
columns, the run-out distance is found to be have a linear relationship with 
the initial aspect ratio of the column.  A power law 
relation is observed between the run-out and the initial aspect ratio of the 
column. The normalised final height as a function of the initial aspect ratio 
of the column is presented in~\cref{fig:heightf}. It can be observed that the 
final collapse height is much higher in fluid than the dry condition. 
The drag force on the granular column reduces the amount of collapse, resulting 
in a shorter run-out distance. The drag force seems to have a predominant 
influence on the run-out behaviour than the lubrication effect in fluid.

\subsection{Effect of permeability}
\citet{Topin2011} observed development of large negative pore pressure during 
dispersion of grains. The rate of dissipation of the negative pore pressure is 
directly proportional to the permeability of the granular assembly. In the 
previous section, the evolution of run-out with the initial aspect ratio is 
studied using a constant hydrodynamic radius r = 0.7 R. In order to understand 
the effect of permeability on the run-out behaviour, the hydrodynamic radius r 
is varied from 0.7 R through 0.95 R. Increase in hydrodynamic radius decreases 
the permeability of the granular assembly resulting in longer duration for the 
dissipation of negative pore pressure. 

The normalise run-out for different hydrodynamic radius for a granular column 
collapse with an initial aspect ratio of 0.8 is presented 
in~\cref{fig:Runout_a08_dense}. The run-out increases with decrease in the 
permeability, which is equivalent to increase in the hydrodynamic radius. An 
increase in the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 to 0.95 R, increases the 
normalised run-out by 25\%. However, even under very low permeable condition (r 
= 0.95 R), the run-out observed in fluid is shorter than the dry and the 
buoyant conditions. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Runout_a08_dense}
\caption{Effect of permeability on the evolution of run-out for a column 
collapse in fluid (a = 0.8)}
\label{fig:Runout_a08_dense}
\end{figure}

At high permeability (r = 0.7 R), the evolution of run-out at the initial stage 
is quicker, which means that the negative pore-pressure that is developed 
during the shearing along the fracture surface is dissipated faster. Even 
though the negative pore-pressure is dissipate, due to 
the development of negative pore-pressure the evolution of run-out in fluid is 
slower than its dry counterpart. The rate of dissipation decreases with 
decrease in the permeability. This can be observed by a flatter slope in the 
run-out evolution with decrease in permeability.~\cref{fig:PWP_ini_dense} shows 
the distribution of pore-pressure in high and low permeable granular media. At 
the same time $ t = \tau_c$, the high permeable (r = 0.7 R) shows smaller 
negative pore-pressure in comparison to large negative pore-pressures observed 
in the shearing zone for low permeable column (r = 0.9 R). This shows that not 
only does it take longer time for the pore-pressure to dissipate with decrease 
in permeability, the negative pore-pressure developed in the low permeable 
condition is almost twice that of high permeable case 
(see~\cref{fig:r095_PWP_ini_dense}).

\end{figure}

Although low permeable granular columns take longer duration for the run-out to 
evolve, the final run-out distance is found to be much longer than high 
permeable condition.~\cref{fig:PE_a08_dense} shows that the potential energy 
available for the flow for low permeable column is ~20\% smaller than the 
collapse of high permeable granular column. The kinetic energy evolution 
(see~\cref{fig:a08_dense_energy}) shows that the low permeable column has a 
wider peak kinetic energy distribution in comparison to a sharp peak observed 
in high permeable condition. This indicates the influence of lubrication, i.e., 
hydroplaning of the granular flow in low permeable conditions. The evolution of 
horizontal kinetic energy reveals that the peak kinetic energy is sustained 
longer as the permeability of the granular material decreases 
(see~\cref{fig:KExy_a08_dense}). Although, the peak kinetic energy is smaller 
in the low permeability case, the hydroplaning of the flowing granular mass 
results in longer run-out distance. A high positive pore-pressure is observed 
at the base of the granular flow in low permeability condition 
(\cref{fig:r095_PWP_flow_dense}) indicating the occurrence of hydroplaning. The 
evolution of local packing density shows a drop in the packing density at low 
permeability (see~\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense}). The drop in the value 
of packing density between $t = 2\tau_c$ and $t=3\tau_c$ corroborates with the 
duration of hydroplaning during which large amount of water in entrained at the 
flow front.

High permeable column shows lower water entrainment, which indicates that at 
highly permeable flows the drag force acting on the soil grains predominates 
over the lubrication effect. In both low permeable and high permeable granular 
flows, the granular material consolidates at the final stage of the flow. This 
can be observed as the packing density increases at the final stage due to 
grains settling and expulsion of entrained water. The final deposit profile for 
both low and high permeability condition is shown 
in~\cref{fig:a08_dense_snapshots}. High permeable collapse show a more 
parabolic (convex) deposit profile in contrast to the more concave profile 
observed in low permeability condition. The observation of hydroplaning in low 
permeable condition may be due to the distribution of the granular mass at the 
flow front. Instigation of hydroplaning is controlled by the balance of gravity 
and inertia forces at the debris front and is suitably characterized by the 
densimetric Froude's number:
%
\begin{equation}
Fr_d = \frac{U}{\sqrt{(\frac{\rho_d}{\rho_w}-1)gH\cos\theta}}
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the average velocity of sliding mass, $\rho_p$ and $\rho_w$ are 
the densities of soil and water, respectively, \textit{H} is the thickness of 
the sliding mass, \textit{g} is acceleration due to gravity and $\theta$ 
represents the slope angle.~\citet{Harbitz2003,Mohrig1998} observed 
hydroplaning above a critical value of densimetric Froude's number of 0.4. A 
$Fr_d$ value of 0.427 is observed for low permeable flow (r = 0.95 R), which 
indicates the occurrence of hydroplaning. Where as a $Fr_d = 0.273$ is observed 
for high permeable granular flow indicating absence of hydroplaning, the low 
permeable collapse is predominated by the viscous drag force resulting in a 
parabolic profile and shorter run-out distance.

The normalised final run-out distance as a function of the initial aspect ratio 
of the column is presented in~\cref{fig:runout_fluid_dry}. For all aspect 
ratios, the dry condition yields the longest run-out distance. For a given 
aspect ratio, the dry collapse acquires the highest kinetic energy due to 
the lack of fluid dissipation during vertical collapse. This extra kinetic 
energy is high enough to propel the heap, in-spite of a high frictional 
dissipation, over a distance that is longer than the run-out distance in 
the fluid regime. In submerged condition, for the same aspect ratio, 
the kinetic energy available for spreading is lower and the dissipation 
due to viscous drag is higher, thus leading to a much shorter run-out
distance. 

For short columns, with decrease in permeability the run-out distance 
increases, however, the run-out distance is not higher than the dry condition. 
At higher aspect ratios, decrease in permeability from r = 0.8 R to r = 0.9 R 
does not have a significant influence on the run-out behaviour. This can be 
attributed to the turbulent nature of the granular flows for tall 
columns. The run-out behaviour is a result of transformation of (part of) the 
initial potential energy to the peak kinetic energy, which in turn controls the 
subsequent run-out along the plane. The run-out distance is plotted as a 
function of the normalised peak kinetic energy 
in~\cref{fig:runout_fluid_dry_energy}. For the same aspect ratio, the peak 
kinetic energy is higher in the case of dry column. This represents grain 
inertial regime in dry granular collapse, which indicates that a part of the 
potential energy, in the presence of the fluid, is dissipated during the 
vertical collapse due to viscous friction. In all regimes, the 
run-out distance increases as a power law $L_f \propto KE_{max}^\gamma$. For 
the same value of peak kinetic energy, the run-out distance in fluid is longer 
than the dry column collapse. Also, with decrease in 
permeability the run-out distance increases for the same peak kinetic energy.

\subsection{Effect of initial packing density}

\citet{Rondon2011} observed that the loose packings flow rapidly on a time
scale proportional to the initial height and results in longer run-out distance 
in comparison to the dense packing. Hydroplaning occurs above a critical 
Froude's number of 0.4. The Froude's number is inversely related to the 
thickness of the flow and its density. Hence, for the same thickness of flow, a 
loose granular column will experience more hydroplaning than a dense granular 
flow. This effect might result in longer run-out behaviour in fluid than the 
dry condition for the same initial aspect ratio. The initial density and the 
permeability of a 2D granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 0.8 is 
varied to understand their influence on the run-out behaviour. The run-out 
behaviour of the dense case (83\% packing density), discussed in the previous 
section, is compared with a loose granular colum (79\% packing fraction). The 
permeability is varied by changing the hydrodynamic radius from 0.7 R to 0.95 
R. 

The normalised run-out evolution with time for a loose initial packing (79\% 
packing fraction) with different hydrodynamic radius 0.7 R, 0.8 R, 0.9 and 0.95 
R. The run-out evolution of dry and a column with grains in suspension with an 
initial aspect ratio of 0.8 is also presented to understand the influence of 
hydrodynamic forces on the flow kinematics. Similar to dense granular column, 
the run-out distance increases with increase in the hydrodynamic radius (i.e., 
decrease in permeability). At low permeability (r = 0.9 and 0.95R), the run-out 
distance is longer than the dry condition. This shows that the lubrication 
effect in low permeability condition overcomes the influence of 
the drag force and the development of large negative pore pressure resulting in 
longer run-out distance. Although suspended granular mass experience high drag 
force and turbulent effects, the run-out evolves almost at the same rate in 
comparison with granular columns with high permeability. This shows the effect 
of permeability on the dissipation rate of negative pore pressure developed 
during the initial stage of collapse.

\caption{Effect of permeability on the evolution of run-out for a column 
collapse in fluid (a = 0.8 \& loose packing)}
\label{fig:Runout_a08_loose}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:Loose_PWP_ini} shows the development of negative pore pressure in low 
permeability (r = 0.95 R) and dissipation of negative pore pressure in high 
permability (r = 0.7 R) at the same time $ t = \tau_c$. This difference in the 
quantity and the rate of dissipation of negative pore pressure results in 
difference in the rate of flow evolution. Low permeable column takes longer 
duration for the flow to evolve. As the flow progresses, low permeability of 
the granular column causes hydroplaning to occur at the base of the column 
resulting in longer run-out distance (see~\cref{fig:Loose_PWP_flow}).

The evolution of potential energy with time reveals that at very low 
permeability (r = 0.95 R), the initial potential energy mobilised is smaller 
than at r = 0.9R. Also with decrease in permeability, the time required to 
dissipate the negative pore pressure increases. This results in a shorter 
run-out distance in the case of r = 0.95 R than r = 0.9 R. As the amount of 
material destabilised is small, which results in a thinner flow having a high 
Froude's number. However, the peak horizontal kinetic velocity observed in the 
case of r = 0.9 R is higher than r = 0.95 R (see~\cref{fig:KExy_a08_loose}).  A 
Froude's number of 0.59 for r = 0.9 R is observed in contrast to 0.46 for r = 
0.94 R. Both values of hydrodynamic radius result in a Froude's number that 
indicates occurrence of hydroplaning. The difference in the amount of material 
destabilised for r = 0.95 R and the decreased effect of hydroplaning results in 
shorter run-out distance for r = 0.95 R in comparison to r = 0.9 R. 


As the column collapses, water is entrained at the flow front. This can 
observed by decrease in the packing fraction during $t = 1\tau_c$ to $t = 
3\tau_c$. As the flow progresses, the entrained water is expelled and the soil 
grains consolidate to reach a critical packing density at the end of the flow 
(see~\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_loose}). The permeability (hydrodynamic 
radius) plays a crucial role in the rate of dissipation of the entrained water. 
As the permeability decreases, the water entrained at the flow front takes 
longer time to be dissipated resulting in lubrication of the flow at low 
permeability. This lubrication effect results in increased run-out for columns 
with low permeability.

The evolution grain trajectories with time is presented in 
~\cref{fig:Loose_a08_permeability} for low permeability (r = 0.95 R) and (r = 
0.9 R). It can be observed that the column with high permeability shows a more 
parabolic (convex) final profile in contrast to the more concave profile 
observed in low permeability condition. This difference in the flow thickness 
results in higher value of Froude's number and the occurrence of hydroplaning 
in low permeability condition. Due to high permeability, the water entrained at 
the flow front is dissipated quicker and thus no lubrication effect is 
observed. A Froude's number of 0.272 (no hydroplaning) is observed for high 
permeability condition (r = 0.7 R). This shows that the drag force predominates 
at high permeability, while the low permeability condition is characterised by 
hydroplaning and lubrication.

~\Cref{fig:effective_stress_a08} shows the normalised pressure at the 
base for low and high permeability flows at $ t = 2\tau_c$. The normalised 
effective stress plotted is obtained as the average over 5 time steps at 
$2\tau_c$. The effective stress at the base is normalised to the effective 
stress of a static granular column before collapse. A value of 1 indicates that 
the effective stress hasn't changed, which is observed in the static region of 
the granular column. It can be observed that the normalised effective stress is 
significantly high for low permeability condition at the flow front in 
comparison to almost non-existence of effective stress in low permeability 
condition. The observation of trivial effective stress at the flow front 
corroborates the lubrication effect observed at low permeability conditions.

\Cref{fig:Dense_Loose_PT} shows the grain trajectories of a dense and a loose 
initial packing for a hydrodynamic radius (r = 0.95R). It can be observed that 
the dense initial packing results in a lot of turbulent behaviour at the flow 
surface in contrast to the more plug like flow observed in the loose condition. 
The thickness of the deposit in both dense and loose condition is almost the 
same, however the density of the flow results in a Froude's number of 0.46 and
0.429 for loose and dense conditions, respectively. The low initial density 
results in more hydroplaning in the loose condition. The effect of water 
entrainment at the flow front between dense and loose condition can be seen 
in~\cref{fig:Dense_Loose_voro}. Comparing the packing density 
(see~\cref{fig:Packing_Density_a08_dense,fig:Packing_Density_a08_loose}) 
reveals almost the same amount of water entrainment in both dense and loose 
conditions. Hence, it is the density of the flowing granular mass that controls 
the influence of hydroplaning for a given hydrodynamic radius and initial 
aspect ratio. A loosely packed granular column with low permeability entrains 
more water at the flow front, resulting in a hydroplaning effect that overcomes 
the influence of viscous drag forces and thereby yields a higher run-out 
distance than the dry condition.

\section{Submarine granular flows down incline plane}

Slope failure is a problem of high practical importance for both civil 
engineering structures and natural hazards management. Catastrophic events as 
landslides, debris flows, rock avalanches or reservoir embankment failures 
exemplify the potential consequences of a soil gravitational instability. One 
of the most critical situation concerns a submerged sandy slope since pore 
pressure changes, related to groundwater seepage flow or soil 
dilation/contraction, can significantly affect the stability of many earth 
structures or natural soils.

In this study, a 2D poly-disperse system ($d_{max}/d_{min} = 1.8$) of circular 
discs in fluid was used to understand the behaviour of granular flows on 
inclined planes (see~\Cref{fig:setup}). The soil column was modelled using 1000 
discs of density \SI{2650}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} and a contact friction angle of 
\SI{26}{\degree}. The collapse of the column was simulated inside a fluid with 
a density of \SI{1000}{\kg\per\cubic\meter}  and a kinematic viscosity of 
\SI{1e-6}{\square\meter\per\second}. The choice of a 2D geometry has the 
advantage of cheaper computational effort than a 3D case, making it feasible to 
simulate very large systems. A granular column of aspect ratio `a' of 0.8 was 
used. A hydrodynamic radius r = 0.9R was adopted during the LBM computations. 
Dry analyses were also performed to study the effect of hydrodynamic forces on 
the run-out distance.


\subsection{Effect of initial density}
The morphology of the granular deposits in fluid is shown to be mainly controlled by the initial volume fraction of the granular mass and not by the aspect ratio of the column~\citep{Rondon2011,Pailha2008}. In order to understand the influence of the initial packing density on the run-out behaviour, a dense sand column (initial packing density, $\Phi=83\%$) and a loose sand column ($\Phi=79\%$) were used. The granular columns collapse and flow down slopes of varying inclinations (\SI{2.5}{\degree}, \SI{5}{\degree} and \SI{7.5}{\degree}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.97\columnwidth]{Runout_dense_slope}
\caption{Evolution of run-out with time (dense)}
\label{fig:run_dense}
\end{figure}

The evolution of run-out distances for a dense sand column with time in dry and submerged conditions for varying slope inclinations are presented in~\cref{fig:run_dense}. The run-out distance is longer in submerged condition than the dry condition for a flow on a horizontal surface. However, with increase in the slope angle the run-out in the fluid decreases.

Dense granular columns in fluid take a longer time to collapse and flow, due to the development of large negative pore-pressures, as the dense granular material dilates during the initial phase of the flow. The morphology of dense granular flows down slopes of varying inclinations at the critical time ($t=\tau_{c}=\sqrt{H/g}$, when the flow is fully mobilised) are shown in~\cref{fig:slope_dense}.

It can be seen that the viscous drag on the dense column tend to predominate over the influence of hydroplaning on the run-out behaviour. This influence can be observed in the smaller peak kinetic energy for granular column in fluid compared to it's dry counterpart (see~\Cref{fig:KE_dense}). With increase in slope angle, the volume of material that dilates increases. This results in large negative pore pressures and more viscous drag on the granular material. Hence, the difference in the run-out between the dry and the submerged condition, for a dense granular assembly, increases with increase in the slope angle.

In contrast to the dense granular columns, the loose granular columns (relative density $I_D=30 \%$) show longer run-out distance in immersed conditions (see~\Cref{fig:run_loose}). The run-out distance in fluid increases with increase in the slope angle compared to the dry cases. Loose granular material tends to entrain more water at the base of the flow front, creating a lubricating surface, which causes longer run-out distance (see~\Cref{fig:slope_loose}). The hydroplaning effect causes an increase in the velocity the loose condition in comparison with the dense condition (see~\Cref{fig:KE_loose}).

The evolution of packing density (see~\Cref{fig:voro}) shows that dense and the 
loose conditions reach similar packing density. This indicates that the dense 
granular column dilates more and is susceptible to higher viscous drag forces. 
Where as in the loose condition, a positive pore-pressure is observed at the 
base of the flow, indicating entrainment of water at the base, i.e. 
hydroplaning resulting in longer run-out distance.

\subsection{Effect of permeability}

For a slope angle of \SI{5}{\degree}, the hydrodynamic radius of the loosely 
packed grains was varied from r = 0.7R (high permeability), 0.75R, 0.8R, 0.85R 
to 0.9R (low permeability). The run-out distance is found to increase with 
decrease in the permeability of the granular assembly (see~\Cref{fig:run5}). 
The run-out distance for high permeable conditions (r = 0.7R -- 0.8R) were 
lower than their dry counterparts. Although, decrease in permeability resulted 
in an increase in the run-out distance, no significant change in the run-out 
behaviour was observed for a hydrodynamic radius of up to 0.8R.

With further decrease in permeability (r = 0.85R and 0.9R), the run-out 
distance in the fluid was greater than the run-out observed in the dry 
condition. At very low permeability (r = 0.9R), granular material started to 
entrain more water at the base, which causes a reduction in the effective 
stress accompanied by a lubrication effect on the flowing granular media. This 
can be seen as a significant increase in the peak kinetic energy and the 
duration of the peak energy, in comparison with dry and high permeable 
conditions (see~\Cref{fig:KE5}).

The permeability of the granular column did not have an influence on the evolution of height during the flow. However, dry granular column tends to collapse more than the immersed granular column (see~\Cref{fig:height5}).

\label{fig:KE5}
\end{figure}

Positive pore-pressure generation at the base of the flow was observed for low 
permeable conditions. Inspection of the local packing density showed 
entrainment of water at the base of the flow, which can also be observed by the 
steep decrease in the packing density (see~\Cref{fig:voro5}) for the very low 
permeability condition (r = 0.9R). At the end of the flow ($t \ge 3 \times 
\tau_c$), the excess pore-pressure dissipates and the granular material, 
irrespective of their permeability, reaches almost the same packing density.

\section{Summary}

Two-dimensional LB-DEM simulations were performed to understand the behaviour 
of submarine granular flows. Unlike dry granular collapse, the run-out 
behaviour in fluid is dictated by the initial volume fraction. Granular columns 
with loose packing tend to flow longer in comparison to dense columns, due to 
entrainment of water at the base resulting in lubrication. The loose column 
when it starts flowing expands and ejects liquid, leading to a partial 
fluidization of the material. However, with increase in the slope angle, the 
run-out in fluid is influenced by the viscous drag on the granular materials. 
The run-out distance in fluid increases with decrease in permeability. More 
research work is required to characterise the flow behaviour of granular 
materials, especially in submerged conditions.
