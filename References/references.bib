abstract = {AbstractThis paper describes a new formulation of the material point method (MPM) for solving coupled hydromechanical problems of fluid-saturated soil subjected to large deformation. A soil–pore fluid coupled MPM algorithm based on Biot’s mixture theory is proposed for solving hydromechanical interaction problems that include changes in water table location with time. The accuracy of the proposed method is examined by comparing the results of the simulation of a one-dimensional consolidation test with the corresponding analytical solution. A sensitivity analysis of the MPM parameters used in the proposed method is carried out for examining the effect of the number of particles per mesh and mesh size on solution accuracy. For demonstrating the capability of the proposed method, a physical model experiment of a large-scale levee failure by seepage is simulated. The behavior of the levee model with time-dependent changes in water table matches well to the experimental observations. The mechanisms of seepage-...},

abstract = {Brittle faults reflect a complex strain history that emerges from contrasting modes of distributed and localised deformation, and their interaction on various spatial and temporal scales. To better understand this process, we monitor the displacement field in scaled tectonic model experiments using high-resolution optical image correlation techniques (particle imaging velocimetry, PIV). 2D and 3D surface displacement data of extensional and contractional sandbox experiments show that the mode, pattern, and temporal variation of strain accumulation are strongly dependent on the non-linear strain-dependent frictional strength of granular model materials similar to natural deformation processes in brittle rocks. Strain hardening and softening control the shear zone formation. The pattern of localised deformation is established much earlier than is visible from visual inspection of the experiment. Evolution of distributed strain in the surrounding material of the shear zones and discontinuous shear re-localisation control later stages irrespective of the kinematic boundary conditions. High-resolution optical strain monitoring quantifies the spatial and temporal patterns of strain accumulation in our model experiments with unprecedented detail. Together with detailed characterisation of the deformation behaviour of the model materials, our experiments will help to re-evaluate important scaling issues, and allow accurate comparison of analogue experiments with numerical simulations.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to examine how the concept of plasticity is used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Rapid mass movements such as snow avalanches or debris flows involve slurries of solid particles (ice, boulder, clay, etc.) within an interstitial fluid (air, water). The bulk behavior of these materials has often been modeled as plastic materials, i.e., a plastic material yields and starts to flow once its stress state has significantly departed from equilibrium. Two plastic theories are of common use in fluid dynamics: Coulomb plasticity and viscoplasticity. These theories have little in common, since ideal Coulomb materials are two-phase materials for which pore pressure and friction play the key role in the bulk dynamics, whereas viscoplastic materials (e.g., Bingham fluids) typically behave as single-phase fluids on the macroscopic scale and exhibit a viscous behavior after yielding. Determining the rheological behavior of geophysical materials remains difficult because they encompass coarse, irregular particles over a very wide range of size. Consequently, the true nature of plastic behavior for geophysical flows is still vigorously debated. In this review, we first set out the continuum-mechanics principles used for describing plastic behavior. The notion of yield surface rather than yield stress is emphasized in order to better understand how tensorial constitutive equations can be derived from experimental data. The notion of single-phase or two-phase behaviors on the macroscopic scale is then examined using a microstructural analysis on idealized suspensions of spheres within a Newtonian fluid; for these suspensions, the single-phase approximation is valid only at very high or low Stokes numbers. Within this framework, the bulk stress tensor can also be constructed, which makes it possible to give a physical interpretation to yield stress. Most of the time, depending on the bulk properties (especially, particle size) and flow features, bulk behavior is either Coulomb-like or viscoplastic in simple-shear experiments. The consequences of the rheological properties on the flow features are also examined. Some remarkable properties of the governing equations describing thin layers flowing down inclined surfaces are discussed. Finally, the question of parameter fitting is tackled: since rheological properties cannot be measured directly in most cases, they must be evaluated from field data. As an example, we show that the Coulomb model successfully captures the main traits of avalanche motion, but statistical analysis demonstrates that the probability distribution of the friction coefficient is not universal.},

abstract = {A new rate-dependent plasticity model for dilative granular media is presented, aiming to bridge the seemingly disparate solid- and fluid-like behavioral regimes. Up to date, solid-like behavior is typically tackled with rate-independent plasticity models emanating from Mohr–Coulomb and Critical State plasticity theory. On the other hand, the fluid-like behavior of granular media is typically treated using constitutive theories amenable to viscous flow, e.g., Bingham fluid. In our proposed model, the material strength is composed of a dilation part and a rate-dependent residual strength. The dilatancy strength plays a key role during solid-like behavior but vanishes in the fluid-like regime. The residual strength, which in a classical plasticity model is considered constant and rate-independent, is postulated to evolve with strain rate. The main appeal of the model is its simplicity and its ability to reconcile the classic plasticity and rheology camps. The applicability and capability of the model are demonstrated by numerical simulation of granular flow problems, as well as a classical shear banding problem, where the performance of the continuum model is compared to discrete particle simulations and physical experiment. These results shed much-needed light onto the mechanics and physics of granular media at various shear rates.},

An equation for determining the length scale is proposed. The proposed length scale equations include the effect of plastic deformation (microrotation), the effect of normal stress and contact area. The proposed length scale is implemented into elastic-elastoplastic Cosserat formulation. The effect of length scale on the finite element simulation and yield surface was evaluated by using the proposed length scale equation. The importance of length scale on the constitutive modeling of granular materials is analyzed in numerical simulations.},

We present an experimental study aimed at analysing the assumptions and the quantitative predictions of such theories. A two-dimensional channel coupled to a model granular material and image analysis allow detailed and complete measurement of the kinematics and structure of the flows. We determine the range of inclination and particle flux for which the flow is stationary and uniform. The characteristic profiles of solid fraction, mean velocity and granular temperature are systematically measured. Both the true collisional and the dilute kinetic regimes are examined. We show that a quasi-hydrodynamic description of these regimes seems relevant, and that the pressure and the viscosity terms are in good qualitative agreement with the prediction of the kinetic theory. The profiles are well described by the kinetic theory near the top of the flow, at low solid fraction. Conversely there are large discrepancies near the rough plane, where the material is structured in layers.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) for solid mechanics conserves mass and mo- mentum by construction, but energy conservation is not explicitly enforced. Material constitutive response and internal energy are carried on discrete points (material points), while the governing equations are solved on an overlying grid. The consti- tutive response (and internal energy) may be updated at the beginning or end of a numerical time step without affecting mass or momentum conservation properties. Both versions of the algorithm have been applied in the literature. Here energy con- servation on the material points is investigated and found to depend strongly on the version of the algorithm used. The energy error is found and partitioned into two terms, one of which is of definite sign (and dissipative). The other term is indefinite, and of opposite sign for the two algorithmic variations. It is shown analytically for a single-material-point free-vibration example that one version of the algorithm is strictly dissipative. For the other version the error terms cancel each other out and energy is conserved. The same trends are borne out in numerical solutions of free axial vibration of continuum bars as the wavelength of the vibrational mode begins to approach the computational cell size. The dissipative algorithm may be described as tending to damp out unresolved modes. For resolved modes, both algorithms give identical results, with no perceptible energy error or dissipation. It is suggested that the dissipative algorithm is a better choice in general, as the damping is consistent with the accuracy of the solution.},

The model, which is based on the FLIP-material point, particle-in-cell method, solves continuum constutitive models for each grain. Interactions between grains are calculated with a contact algorithm that forbids interpenetration, but allows separation and sliding and rolling with friction. The particle-in-cell method eliminates the need for a separate contact detection step. The use of a common rest frame in the contact model yields a linear scaling of the computational cost with the number of grains. The properties of the model are illustrated by numerical solutions of sliding and rolling contacts, and for granular materials by a shear calculation. The results of numerical calculations demonstrate that contacts are modeled accurately for smooth granules whose shape is resolved by the computations mesh.},

The front of the current is "immobilized" and observed in a fixed frame of reference by letting the current flow inside a rotary drum, big enough to make curvature effects negligible. The study addresses the motion of beds made of particles of different size and density, corresponding to different values of the incipient fluidization velocity. The establishment of a variety of flow regimes, including intermittent avalanching, periodic "plunging breaking" and permanent fluidization of the granular solids in the frontal zone has been recorded. Flow regimes have been related to flow conditions and to the nature of the granular solids with an attempt to define a criterion for the self-fluidization of the current. Results suggest that such a criterion should include the canonical Froude number, determining the onset of front instabilities, and the ratio of the incipient fluidization velocity of the bed solids to the velocity of the current. The relative importance of the establishment of a purely "granular liquid" state versus fluidization due to gas entrainment is addressed and discussed with a focus on the effects on solids flowability.},

Both collisions with field particles (supposed to be elastic) and inelastic collisions of the grains between themselves (with nonconstant restitution coefficient) are taken into account, leading to the simultaneous presence of two different collision operators. The closure problem for the macroscopic transport equations in a collision-dominated regime is mainly addressed. Two different approximations, one based on local equilibrium and the other on a Grad-type expansion, are worked out. Results relevant to collision equilibria and to the hydrodynamic limit coincide to first-order accuracy in the small parameter (Navier-Stokes level).

abstract = {The flow and sediment transport in the boundary layer at the sea bottom due to the passage of surface waves are determined by considering small values of the wave steepness and of the ratio between the thickness of the boundary layer and the local water depth. Both the velocity field and the sediment transport rate are determined up to the second order of approximation thus evaluating both the steady streaming and the net (wave-averaged) flux of sediment induced by nonlinear effects. The flow regime is assumed to be turbulent and a two-equation turbulence model is used to close the problem. The bed load is evaluated by means of an empirical relationship as function of the bed shear stress. The suspended load is determined by computing the sediment flux, once the sediment concentration is determined by solving an appropriate advection–diffusion equation. The decay of the wave amplitude, which is due to the energy dissipation taking place in the boundary layer, is taken into account. The steady streaming and the sediment transport rate at the bottom of sea waves turn out to be different from those which are observed in a wave tunnel (U-tube), because of the dependence on the streamwise coordinate of the former flow. In particular, in the range of the parameters presently investigated, the sediment transport rate at the bottom of sea waves is found to be always onshore directed while, in a water tunnel (U-tube), the sediment transport rate can be onshore or offshore directed.},

abstract = {The generalization of the Boltzmann and Enskog kinetic equations to allow inelastic collisions provides a basis for studies of granular media at a fundamental level. For elastic collisions the significant technical challenges presented in solving these equations have been circumvented by the use of corresponding model kinetic equations. The objective here is to discuss the formulation of model kinetic equations for the case of inelastic collisions. To illustrate the qualitative changes resulting from inelastic collisions the dynamics of a heavy particle in a gas of much lighter particles is considered first. The Boltzmann–Lorentz equation is reduced to a Fokker–Planck equation and its exact solution is obtained. Qualitative differences from the elastic case arise primarily from the cooling of the surrounding gas. The excitations, or physical spectrum, are no longer determined simply from the Fokker–Planck operator, but rather from a related operator incorporating the cooling effects. Nevertheless, it is shown that a diffusion mode dominates for long times just as in the elastic case. From the spectral analysis of the Fokker–Planck equation an associated kinetic model is obtained. In appropriate dimensionless variables it has the same form as the BGK kinetic model for elastic collisions, known to be an accurate representation of the Fokker–Planck equation. On the basis of these considerations, a kinetic model for the Boltzmann equation is derived. The exact solution for states near the homogeneous cooling state is obtained and the transport properties are discussed, including the relaxation toward hydrodynamics. As a second application of this model, it is shown that the exact solution for uniform shear flow arbitrarily far from equilibrium can be obtained from the corresponding known solution for elastic collisions. Finally, the kinetic model for the dense fluid Enskog equation is described.},

abstract = {X-ray computerised tomography (CT) is a non-contacting and non-destructive inspection technique which provides cross-sectional images in different planes through a component. CT images also provide information on the local material X-ray attenuation coefficients at each point in the image. In general, for a particular material, X-ray attenuation is approximately proportional to material density. In practice, however, a number of instrumental factors including the non-linear effects of "beam hardening" and diffuse scattered radiation complicate the quantitative measurement of density variations in materials using CT. Techniques have been developed for the quantitative non-destructive mapping of density variations in materials and implemented on TOMOHAWK – AEA Technology's PC-based CT system, which is used in conjunction with real-time X-ray imaging equipment. Results are given from the application of these techniques to the measurement of density variations within powder compacts both in the green and sintered states. Other recent TOMOHAWK developments and applications are also briefly reviewed.},

They are too dangerous to be approached and studied directly and, for this reason, experiments are necessary to understand their flow mechanisms. Here, we present the results of experiments on granular flow mobility obtained releasing batches of angular rock fragments down a curved chute. Our experiments demonstrate that the finer the grain size of the flow, the larger its mobility. This is accompanied by a decrease of fragments' agitation when grain size decreases as shown by particle image velocimetry measurements of high-speed video camera images. The smaller the agitation, the smaller is also the energy dissipated by flows per unit of travel distance. This explains the effect of finer grain size on flow mobility. These results are an important step towards the prediction of runout distances as a function of the features that characterize the different geophysical flows.},

abstract = {This paper describes computer simulation studies of granular materials under dense conditions where particles are in persistent contact with their neighbours and the elasticity of the material becomes an important rheological parameter. There are two regimes at this limit, one for which the stresses scale with both elastic and inertial properties (called the elastic\&ndash;inertial regime), and a non-inertial quasi-static regime in which the stresses scale purely elastically (elastic\&ndash;quasi-static). In these elastic regimes, the forces are generated by internal force chains. Reducing the concentration slightly causes a transition from an elastic to a purely inertial behaviour. This transition occurs so abruptly that a 2\% concentration reduction can be accompanied by nearly three orders of magnitude of stress reduction. This indicates that granular flows near this limit are prone to instabilities such as those commonly observed in shear cells. Unexpectedly, there is no path between inertial (rapid) flow and quasi-static flow by varying the shear rate at a fixed concentration; only by reducing the concentration can one cause a transition from quasi-static to inertial flow. The solid concentrations at which this transition occurs as well as the magnitude of the stresses in the elastic regimes are strong functions of the particle surface friction, because the surface friction strongly affects the strength of the force chains. A parametric analysis of the elastic regime generated flowmaps showing the various regimes that might be realized in practice. Many common materials such as sand require such large shear rates to reach the elastic\&ndash;inertial regime that it is unattainable for all practical purposes; such materials will demonstrate either an elastic\&ndash;quasi-static behaviour or a pure inertial behaviour depending on the concentration \&ndash; with many orders of magnitude of stress change between them. Finally, the effects of nonlinear contacts are investigated and an appropriate scaling is proposed that accounts for the nonlinear behaviour in the elastic\&ndash;quasi-static regime.},

abstract = {The paper attempts to give a critical overview of the field of granular flow with attention both to the history and the underlying physics that govern the field. It starts with a discussion of the basic transport mechanisms in a granular flow. It continues with a discussion of contact mechanics - the way that individual particles see each other mechanically. It then discusses the historical limiting regimes of granular flow, the Quasistatic and the Rapid-Flow regimes. Finally, it concludes with a review of the Elastic picture of granular flow, which both unifies the Quasistatic and Rapid regimes and fills in the intervening space. It shows that the rheological behavior of granular systems changes with system scale constraints, and, in particular, that the materials behave differently under controlled-stress and controlled-concentration conditions. The Elastic model defines an entire flowmap of granular flow and thus allows one to place boundaries on where the Quasistatic and Rapid-Flow models (sometimes called kinetic theory models) are something of a red herring and cannot be applied to common granular flows.},

abstract = {The understanding of the dense granular flow regime (intermediate between quasi-static and collisional regimes) has recently progressed significantly. We shall review the results concerning the friction law, which we have obtained with the help of discrete numerical simulations of flow of assemblies of disks in various geometries (homogeneous plane shear, annular shear and inclined plane). In the case of cohesionless quasi-mono-dispersed and rigid grains, the analysis of the dependencies of the effective friction coefficient, ratio of shear to normal stress, on the shear state (defined by the shear rate and pressure) and on the mechanical characteristics of the material has made possible the formulation of a local constitutive law. This has shown the crucial role of a dimensionless parameter, called inertial number, which rules the friction law in the dense regime. This law remains true in the case of bi-dispersed flows, as early as the average diameter of the grains in taken into account. It is also true in the case of cohesive grains, once a second dimensionless number, characterizing the intensity of cohesion, is introduced.},

In both cases a family of solitary erosion/deposition waves are observed. At higher inclination angles, we show the existence of a long wavelength transverse instability followed by a coarsening and the onset of a fingering pattern. While the experiments strongly differ by the spatial and time scales, the agreement between the stability diagram, the wavelengths selection and the avalanche morphology suggest a common erosion/deposition scenario. These experiments are studied theoretically in the framework of the "partial fluidization" model of dense granular flows. This model identifies a family of propagating solitary waves displaying a behavior similar to the experimental observation. A primary cause for the transverse instability is related to the dependence of avalanche velocity on the granular mass trapped by the flow. 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

For an ideal cohesionless granular material, which satisfies the Coulomb-Mohr yield condition, the number of known analytical solutions is limited.

These solutions are the only known analytical solutions of this generality. Here, we utilize the double-shearing theory of granular materials to determine the velocity field corresponding to these exact parametric solutions for the two problems of gravity flow through converging wedge and conical hoppers. An independent numerical solution for other angles of internal friction is shown to coincide with the analytical solution.},

The constitutive equation obtained has the same form as a multidimensional Bingham fluid model, albeit with apparent viscosity and yield stress that depend on the vertical normal stress. The model is applied to previously published experimental results dealing with shear flows of granular beds made up of cohesionless spherical particles. The first case analyzed corresponds to a granular bed moving on top of a rotating disk. The model captures the main trends of the velocity profiles with a single adjustable parameter. The second case is a conventional Couette flow, for which the model is capable of representing the velocity and solids fraction profiles measured experimentally.},

Data from the South Ashburton rock avalanche deposit show that its runout behaviour differs only slightly from that of the laboratory avalanches, extending the range of this behaviour to granular avalanches with volumes of about 100 000 m3. By contrast, data from much larger rock avalanches (107 m3) depart significantly from the trends of the laboratory data; some factor not present in the laboratory, such as rock fragmentation or the presence of an erodible substrate, must influence the behaviour of these larger events. Travel angles as low as 13 in the laboratory tests result from grain flow mechanisms with normal friction coefficients; they are not associated only with large-volume events and do not necessarily indicate unusual material mobility at any scale.},

abstract = {This paper considers a model that reproduces the dynamics of snow avalanches from initiation to runout for a given terrain topography and given the volume, shape and position of the initial mass. According to the Savage-Hutter theory, the granular avalanche is treated as an incompressible cohesionless continuum, which satisfies a Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion and with a Coulomb-type friction law at the bottom. The internal and bottom friction angles, and , are the only rheological parameters to be set. The balance laws of mass and momentum are simplified imposing the "shallow water" assumption and then averaged along the vertical direction. The momentum balance along the direction normal to the bottom reduces to a hydrostatic distribution of pressure in a form which includes the centrifugal forces due to the curvature. The stress tensor is written in a coordinate system independent of the topography and related to the velocity vector. The numerical model is validated by laboratory experiments, performed at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Trento, and by comparing the simulation results with data collected from the literature. The applicability of the model to natural snow avalanches is discussed with reference to observations on granular avalanches reported in the literature and to the surveys carried out at the Lavina Granda and Spini Valley avalanche sites in Trentino Province (Italy). 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The distinct element method (DEM) has proven to be reliable and effective in characterizing the behavior of particles in granular flow simulations. However, in the past, the influence of different force-displacement models on the accuracy of the simulated collision process has not been well investigated. In this work, three contact force models are applied to the elementary case of an elastic collision of a sphere with a flat wall. The results are compared, on a macroscopic scale, with the data provided by the experiments of Kharaz et al. (Powder Technol. 120 (2001) 281) and, on a microscopic scale, with the approximated analytical solution derived by Maw et al. (Wear 38 (1976) 101. The force-displacement models considered are: a linear model, based on a Hooke-type relation; a non-linear model, based on the Hertz theory (J. Reine Angew. Math. 92 (1882) 156) for the normal direction and the no-slip solution of the theory developed by Mindlin and Deresiewicz (Trans. ASME. Ser. E, J. Appl. Mech. 20 (1953) 327) for the tangential direction; a non-linear model with hysteresis, based on the complete theory of Hertz and Mindlin and Deresiewicz for elastic frictional collisions. All the models are presented in fully displacement-driven formulation in order to allow a direct inclusion in DEM-based codes. The results show that, regarding the values of the velocities at the end of collision, no significant improvements can be attained using complex models. Instead, the linear model gives even better results than the no-slip model and often it is equivalent to the complete Mindlin and Deresiewicz model. Also in the microscopic scale, the time evolution of the tangential forces, velocities and displacements predicted by the linear model shows better agreement with the theoretical solution than the no-slip solution. However, this only happens if the parameters of the linear model are precisely evaluated. The examination of the evolution of the forces, velocities and displacements during the collision emphasizes the importance of correct accounting for non-linearity in the contact model and micro-slip effects. It also demonstrates how these phenomena need to be considered into the model in order to perform deeper analyses on granular material in motion and, in general, for systems sensitive to the actual force or displacement. For these cases, more accurate models such as the complete Mindlin and Deresiewicz model should be addressed.},

abstract = {We study water-immersed granular avalanches in a long rectangular cell of small thickness. By video means, both the angle of the granular pile and the velocity profiles of the grains across the depth are recorded as a function of time. These measurements give access to the instantaneous granular flux. By inclining the pile at initial angles larger than the maximum angle of stability, avalanches are triggered and last for a long time, up to several hours for small grains, during which both the slope angle and the granular flux relax slowly. We show that the relaxation is quasi-steady so that there is no inertia: the relaxation at a given time is controlled only by the slope angle at that time. This allows us to adapt a frictional model developed recently for dry or water-immersed grains flowing in stationary conditions. This model succeeds well in reproducing our unsteady avalanche flows, namely the flowing layer thickness, the granular flux and the temporal relaxation of the slope. When a water counter-flow is applied along the pile, the granular avalanches are slowed down and behave as if granular friction were increased by an amount proportional to the water flow. All these findings are also reproduced well with the same friction model by taking into account the additional fluid force. 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Positions, velocities and rotations of individual particles obtained from high-speed motion pictures of essentially two-dimensional flows of plastic spheres in an inclined glass-walled chute were used to test critical assumptions of microstructural theories for the flow of granular materials. The measurements provide a well-defined set of observations for refining and validating computer simulations of granular flows, and point out some important limitations of physical experiments. Two nearly steady, uniform, collisional flows of 6-mm-diameter plastic spheres over a fixed bed of similar spheres inclined at 42.75\&deg; were analysed in detail. Particle fluxes were about 2230 particles s\&minus;1 and 1280 particles s\&minus;1. The nominal depth in both flows was about 18 particle diameters. Profiles of mean downstream velocity and mean rotations, translational temperature and rotational temperature, and bulk density in the flows show slip at the bed of 17 and 26\% of the mean flow velocity for the high- and low-flux flows, respectively; mean rotation rates \$\o verline\o mega\_x\$ and \$\o verline\o mega\_y\$ less than 9\% of \$\o verline\o mega\_z\$ (\$\backslash hate\_x\$ parallel to the bed, \$\backslash hate\_x\$ normal to the sidewall); translational temperature nearly independent of distance from the bed; rotational temperature decreasing with distance from the bed; and density decreasing almost linearly with distance from the bed. The continuum hypothesis (i.e. small gradients in mean-flow properties) is satisfied throughout the flow except near the fixed bed, where large gradients in the mean rotation \$\o verline\o mega\_z\$ and downstream velocity occur over a few particle diameters. The distributions of velocities and rotations are approximately Maxwellian, except near the fixed bed. Testing microstructural theories with physical experiments is severely hampered by limitations on material properties of particles, flow lengthscale and the spatial and temporal resolution of observations. Only a small volume of the parameter space for collision-dominated flows can reasonably be explored by physical experiment. Extraneous forces due to air drag, sidewall friction and electrical effects are not included in theories but must be addressed in physical experiments. Properly designed experiments are the essential link between computer simulations and theory, because they focus attention on particular features critical to testing the simulations, which in turn provide detailed particle-scale information needed to test theories.},

abstract = {Surface flow of granular material is investigated within a continuum approach in two dimensions. The dynamics is described by the nonlinear coupling between a mobile layer and an erodible bed of static grains. Following previous studies, we use mass and momentum conservation to derive St. Venant - like equations for the evolution of the thickness R of the mobile layer and the profile Z of the bed. This approach allows the rheology in the flowing layer to be specified independently, and we consider in detail the two following models: a constant plug flow and a linear velocity profile. We study and compare these models for nonstationary avalanches triggered by a localized amount of mobile grains on a bed of initially constant slope. We solve analytically the nonlinear dynamical equations by the method of characteristics. This enables us to investigate the temporal evolution of the avalanche size, amplitude, and shape as a function of model parameters and initial conditions. In particular, we can compute their large time behavior as well as the condition for the formation of shocks. 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We investigate a class of granular materials characterized by the possibility of interlocking between the particles. The interlocking is modeled by its effect through rolling resistance depending on relative rotation and normal force at the contact points and involving a single parameter analogous to the sliding friction coefficient. The model, which is introduced in the framework of the contact dynamics method, is applied to simulate the simple shear of a large granular sample. We present a detailed analysis regarding the influence of rolling and sliding friction parameters on the macroscopic response in terms of shear strength, fabric properties, and force transmission. Interestingly, two distinct regimes can be distinguished in which the steady-state shear strength is controlled by either rolling resistance or sliding friction. The relative contributions of rolling and sliding contacts to the shear strength are consistent with the same two regimes. Interlocking strongly affects the force network by enhancing the arching effect and thus increasing the relative importance of weak contact forces and torques, which is reflected in a decreasing power-law probability distribution of the contact forces and torques below the mean. Due to the combined effect of friction and interlocking, the force-carrying backbone takes an increasingly columnar aspect involving a low fraction of particles. Our data suggest that the nature of the weak contact network is strongly affected by the formation of these columns of particles which do not need to be propped laterally. In particular, in the limit of high rolling resistance and sliding friction, the role of the weak network of contacts is no longer to prop the force chains, but, like the strong contact network, to actively sustain the deviatoric load imposed on the system.},

The need for a model that accurately describes the gravity flow of a wide variety of granular materials is greatly needed for the design of equipment such as grain drills, storage bins, and others used in all types of industries. In addition to only having a model that predicts flow, the model should have a physical basis so that the laws governing flow is known. Four different models have been reviewed, tested, and evaluated for the level at which each predicts the flow of granular material through circular orifices. Material with a bulk density ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 g/cm3 were used in the evaluation. All orifices tested were circular and horizontal with sizes ranging from 1.3 to 10.5 cm, and flow was by gravity only. Comparison of the results showed that the goodness of fit as measured by R2 ranged from 0.30 to 0.99, with a significance level as high as 99.9 percent ([alpha] = 0.001). Of the models tested, two showed excellent results: the Gregory and Fedler (1987) model and the Beverloo et al. (1961) model.},

This correlation resulting from inertia defines an intermediate "neutral" angle that characterizes the corresponding granular pile. In addition, an intensive study of the dynamics of the avalanche shows that the time duration of the avalanche is correlated to its amplitude, being smaller for higher amplitude. The time relaxation of the pile slope during any avalanche, governed by the deviation of the starting angle from the neutral angle, follows a master curve.

abstract = {Dynamic compaction is a widely used method for improvement of loose granular deposits. Its applicability in saturated layers generally considered to be less effective because of the fact that part of the applied energy is absorbed by pore water. Up to now the majority of numerical simulations have focused on the analysis of dynamic compaction in dry/moist soils. In this paper, a fully coupled hydro-mechanical finite element code has been developed and employed to evaluate the dynamic compaction effects on saturated granular soils. After verification of the results by comparing the numerical results with those measured in a real field case of DC treatment in a highway, some sensitivity analyses have been performed to evaluate the effect of water phase on the dimensions of the zone of improvement in the soil beneath the tamper. The results indicate that in the DC process the soil demonstrate two different behaviors. At the very early stage after impact, the soil behaves in an undrained manner and high oscillation of pore pressure occurs. After this phase, consolidation begins during which the pore-water-flow out of the soil mass takes place. The numerical analysis reveals that most of the DC improvement occurs during the undrained phase. The main mechanism responsible for the densification of soil during the undrained phase seems to be the compressibility of pore water. The simulation results indicate that the improvement zone diminishes when the degree of saturation increases.},

Numerical results were compared to those obtained experimentally by Lajeunesse et al. (Phys Fluids 17:103302, 2005 ) from a similar configuration. Runout distance, temporal flow evolution, deposit morphology and internal flow structures of similar laboratory experiments were quantitatively reproduced as well as prediction of empirical and theoretical scaling laws.

Careful criteria, local in time and space, are designed such that particles become frozen only at mechanically stable positions. The homogeneous deposition over a static surface and the dynamics of a rotating drum are studied as test cases. The simulations agree with previous experimental results.

abstract = {Segregation and mixing of dissimilar grains is a problem in many industrial and pharmaceutical processes, as well as in hazardous geophysical flows, where the size-distribution can have a major impact on the local rheology and the overall run-out. In this paper, a simple binary mixture theory is used to formulate a model for particle-size segregation and diffusive remixing of large and small particles in shallow gravity-driven free-surface flows. This builds on a recent theory for the process of kinetic sieving, which is the dominant mechanism for segregation in granular avalanches provided the density-ratio and the size-ratio of the particles are not too large. The resulting nonlinear parabolic segregation-remixing equation reduces to a quasi-linear hyperbolic equation in the no-remixing limit. It assumes that the bulk velocity is incompressible and that the bulk pressure is lithostatic, making it compatible with most theories used to compute the motion of shallow granular free-surface flows. In steady-state, the segregation-remixing equation reduces to a logistic type equation and the 'S'-shaped solutions are in very good agreement with existing particle dynamics simulations for both size and density segregation. Laterally uniform time-dependent solutions are constructed by mapping the segregation-remixing equation to Burgers equation and using the Cole-Hopf transformation to linearize the problem. It is then shown how solutions for arbitrary initial conditions can be constructed using standard methods. Three examples are investigated in which the initial concentration is (i) homogeneous, (ii) reverse graded with the coarse grains above the fines, and, (iii) normally graded with the fines above the coarse grains. Time-dependent two-dimensional solutions are also constructed for plug-flow in a semi-infinite chute. 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional depth-integrated theory is derived for the gravity-driven free surface flow of cohesionless granular avalanches over complex shallow basal topography. This is an important extension of the one-dimensional Savage-Hutter theory. A simple curvilinear coordinate system is adopted, which is fitted to the 'mean' downslope chute topography. This defines a quasi-two-dimensional reference surface on top of which shallow three-dimensional basal topography is superposed. The governing equations are expressed in the curvilinear coordinate system and the mass- and momentum-balance equations are integrated through the avalanche depth. An ordering argument and a Mohr-Coulomb closure model are used to obtain a simple reduced system of equations. Laboratory experiments have been performed on a partly confined chute to validate the theory. An avalanche is released on a section inclined at 40 degrees to the horizontal, on which there is a concave parabolic cross-slope profile, and runs out through a smooth transition zone onto a horizontal plane. A comparison of the experiment with numerical solutions shows that the avalanche tail speed is under-predicted. A modification to the bed-friction angle is proposed, which brings theory and experiment into very good agreement. The partly confined chute channels the flow and results in significantly longer maximum run-out distances than on an unconfined chute. A simple shallow-water avalanche model is also derived and tested against the experimental results.},

Based on this, the balance laws of mass and linear momentum and kinematic and stress boundary conditions at the free surface and the base are used to derive depth-averaged dynamic equations that describe the temporal evolution of the height and the depth-averaged horizontal velocity components as functions of position and time.

In dense flows, gear states in which all contacts roll without frictional sliding are naively possible below critical coordination numbers.We construct an explicit example of such a state in D = 2; and show that organized shear can exist in this state only on scales l \&lt; d/I, where d is the grain size and I is the Inertial Number, characterizing the balance between inertial and pressure forces in the flow. Above this scale the packing is destabilized by centrifugal forces. Similar conclusions can be drawn in disordered packings of grains. We comment on the possible relationship between this length scale l and that which has been hypothesized to control the rheology.},

abstract = {Particle–fluid systems encountered in many scientific and engineering applications impose a significant modelling challenge. This paper outlines a new solution strategy that couples lattice Boltzmann (LB), large eddy simulation (LES), and discrete element (DE) methodologies for the simulation of particle–fluid systems at moderately high Reynolds numbers. The following main computational issues are considered: (1) the use of the standard LB formulation for the solution of fluid flows; (2) the incorporation of the one-parameter Smagorinski turbulence model in the LB equations for turbulent flows; (3) the utilisation of one immersed boundary scheme for computing hydrodynamic interaction forces between the fluid and moving particles; and (4) the use of DE methods accounting for the interaction between solid particles. The new contributions made in the current work include the application of the Smagorinski turbulence model to moving particles and the proposal of a subcycling time integration scheme for the DE modelling in order to ensure an overall stable LB–DE solution. A complex transport problem involving 70 large moving particles with moderately high Reynolds number (around 56,000) is provided to demonstrate the capability of the presented coupling strategy.},

(1994), has been developed to simulate large deformations and failure evolution involving different material phases in a single computational domain. A continuum body is divided into a finite number of subregions represented by Lagrangian material points, while the governing equations are formulated and solved with the Eulerian grid. Since this grid can be chosen arbitrarily, mesh tangling does not appear in the MPM. To design a simple but robust spatial discretization procedure, the MPM is coupled with the finite difference method (FDM) in the present study for simulating fully and partially saturated elasto-plastic soil responses based on the simplified three-phase method. Governing equations for the soil skeleton and the pore fluid are discretized by the MPM and FDM, respectively. Soil-water coupled analyses for fully saturated soils and seepage-deformation coupled analyses for unsaturated soils are performed, and the potential of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical examples.},

These equations turn out to be deceptive because although simple in appearance, the determination of simple exact solutions is non-trivial. Here we show that all the known functional forms of existing solutions also arise systematically by consideration of the "optimal systems" of the classical Lie symmetries which indicates that any further solution types most likely arise from non-classical symmetries. For one of the known families we present a special case which admits a particularly simple closed form expression, which has not been previously given in the literature. For this particular special case the integral curves (streamlines) can be readily obtained as well as a simple analytical "approximation" for the particle paths. The streamlines and the validity of the analytical approximation are shown graphically.},

abstract = {The slumping and subsequent arrest of initially motionless granular materials from behind a rapidly removed lockgate in a sloping two-dimensional channel is considered theoretically and experimentally. The theory is based upon a shallow layer description of the flow and arrest of the grains in which resistance to the downslope motion is modelled as a Coulomb drag with a constant coefficient of friction. The flows leave a thin layer of deposited material along the chute and the depth of the deposit at the rear of the lock is predicted from the theoretical model using asymptotic techniques. This analysis explains the dependence on the initial aspect ratio of the release that has been seen in previous numerical and experimental studies of granular slumps over horizontal surfaces. The theoretical predictions of this depth are also compared with laboratory observations of the slumping of four dry granular materials. It is shown that there is quantitative agreement between the experimental measurements and the theoretical predictions, which include no fitting parameters. The theoretical predictions for the length along the chute that the materials slump, however, are not in agreement with the theoretical model and potential reasons for this mismatch are discussed.

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) combined with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique is applied to investigate complicated fluid-structure interactions (FSI) such as aircraft wing flutter and other aeroelastic problems. The advantage of MPM over traditional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) methods is its computational efficiency, accuracy and robustness. MPM avoids explicit discretization of convection terms in momentum equations and the fluid-structure interaction is realized by coupling the fluid and solid stress at the interface. The states of material points are updated through the solution on background Cartesian grid node which is fixed during the calculation, thus no mesh distortion problem needs to be dealing with in the case of large deformation. The dynamic AMR can effectively decrease the total number of background mesh nodes and material points for complicated FSI problems. Preliminary results indicate that MPM with dynamic AMR can be a powerful tool to simulate FSI/aeroelastic problems for aerial vehicles. A 3D MPM code (a part of ASTE-P toolset) has been developed at Advanced Dynamics Inc. (ADI) with the ability to model complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems.

abstract = {Summary This paper describes a model to predict the flow of an initially stationary mass of cohesionsless granular material down a rough curved bed and checks it against laboratory experiments that were conducted with two different kinds of granular materials that are released from rest and travel in a chute consisting of a straight inclined section, a curved segment that is followed by a straight horizontal segment. This work is of interest in connection with the motion of landslides, rockfalls and ice and dense flow snow avalanches. Experiments were performed with two different granular materials, nearly spherical glass beads of 3 mm nominal diameter, Vestolen particles (a light plastic material) of lense type shape and 4 mm nominal diameter and 2,5 mm height. Piles of finite masses of these granular materials with various initial shapes and weight were released from rest in a 100 mm wide chute with the mentioned bent profile. The basal surface consisted of smooth PVC, but was in other experiments also coated with drawing paper and with sandpaper. The granular masses under motion were photographed and partly video filmed and thus the geometry of the avalanche was recorded as a function of position and time. For the two granular materials and for the three bed linings the angle of repose and the bed friction angle were determined. The experimental technique with which the laboratory avalanches were run are described in detail as is the reliability of the generated data. We present and use the depth-averaged field equations of balance of mass and linear momentum as presented by Savage and Hutter [28]. These are partial differential equations for the depth averaged streamwise velocity and the distribution of the avalanche depth and involve two phenomenological parameters, the internal angle of friction, \o, and a bed friction angle, $\delta$, both as constitutive properties of Coulomb-type behaviour. We present the model but do not derive its equations. The numerical integration scheme for these equations is a Lagrangian finite difference scheme used earlier by Savage and Hutter [27],[28]. We present this scheme for completeness but do not discuss its peculiarities. Comparison of the theoretical results with experiments is commenced by discussing the implementation of the initial conditions. Observations indicate that with the onset of the motion a dilatation is involved that should be accomodated for in the definition of the initial conditions. Early studies of the temporal evolution of the trailing and leading edges of the granular avalanche indicate that their computed counterparts react sensitively to variations in the bed friction angle but not to those of the internal angle of friction. Furthermore, a weak velocity dependence of the bed friction angle, $\delta$, is also scen to have a small, but negligible influence on these variables. We finally compare the experimental results with computational findings for many combinations of the masses of the granular materials and bed linings. It is found that the experimental results and the theoretical predictions agree satisfactorily. They thus validate the simple model equations that were proposed in Savage and Hutter [28].},

abstract = {The Savage-Hutter (SH) avalanche model is a depth-averaged dynamical model of a fluid-like continuum implementing the following simplifying assumptions: (i) density preserving, (ii) shallowness of the avalanche piles and small topographic curvatures, (iii) Coulomb-type sliding with bed friction angle $\delta$ and (iv) Mohr-Coulomb behaviour in the interior with internal angle of friction ϕ≥$\delta$ and an ad hoc assumption reducing the number of Mohr's circles in three-dimensional stress states to one. We scrutinize the available literature on information regarding these assumptions and thus delineate the ranges of validity of the proposed model equations. The discussion is limited to relatively large snow avalanches with negligible powder snow component and laboratory sand avalanches starting on steep slopes. The conclusion of the analysis is that the SH model is a valid model for sand avalanches, but its Mohr-Coulomb sliding law may have to be complemented for snow avalanches by a second velocity-dependent contribution. For very small snow avalanches and for laboratory avalanches starting on moderately steep and bumpy slopes it may not be adequate.},

Constitutive equations are postulated for the dispersive pressure, viscosity, "thermal diffusivity" and energy annihilation rate in terms of the mean free path length, the time of encounter between two collisions and geometric and dynamic quantities via dimensional arguments. The model defines the time of encounter to consist of the free flying time between collisions plus the contact duration.

abstract = {Recent advances in theory and experimentation motivate a thorough reassessment of the physics of debris flows. Analyses of flows of dry, granular solids and solid-fluid mixtures provide a foundation for a comprehensive debris flow theory, and experiments provide data that reveal the strengths and limitations of theoretical models. Both debris flow materials and dry granular materials can sustain shear stresses while remaining static; both can deform in a slow, tranquil mode characterized by enduring, frictional grain contacts; and both can flow in a more rapid, agitated mode characterized by brief, inelastic grain collisions. In debris flows, however, pore fluid that is highly viscous and nearly incompressible, composed of water with suspended silt and clay, can strongly mediate intergranular friction and collisions. Grain friction, grain collisions, and viscous fluid flow may transfer significant momentum simultaneously. Both the vibrational kinetic energy of solid grains (measured by a quantity termed the granular temperature) and the pressure of the intervening pore fluid facilitate motion of grains past one another, thereby enhancing debris flow mobility. Granular temperature arises from conversion of flow translational energy to grain vibrational energy, a process that depends on shear rates, grain properties, boundary conditions, and the ambient fluid viscosity and pressure. Pore fluid pressures that exceed static equilibrium pressures result from local or global debris contraction. Like larger, natural debris flows, experimental debris flows of \&\#8764;10 m³ of poorly sorted, water-saturated sediment invariably move as an unsteady surge or series of surges. Measurements at the base of experimental flows show that coarse-grained surge fronts have little or no pore fluid pressure. In contrast, finer-grained, thoroughly saturated debris behind surge fronts is nearly liquefied by high pore pressure, which persists owing to the great compressibility and moderate permeability of the debris. Realistic models of debris flows therefore require equations that simulate inertial motion of surges in which high-resistance fronts dominated by solid forces impede the motion of low-resistance tails more strongly influenced by fluid forces. Furthermore, because debris flows characteristically originate as nearly rigid sediment masses, transform at least partly to liquefied flows, and then transform again to nearly rigid deposits, acceptable models must simulate an evolution of material behavior without invoking preternatural changes in material properties. A simple model that satisfies most of these criteria uses depth-averaged equations of motion patterned after those of the Savage-Hutter theory for gravity-driven flow of dry granular masses but generalized to include the effects of viscous pore fluid with varying pressure. These equations can describe a spectrum of debris flow behaviors intermediate between those of wet rock avalanches and sediment-laden water floods. With appropriate pore pressure distributions the equations yield numerical solutions that successfully predict unsteady, nonuniform motion of experimental debris flows.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Field observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical analyses indicate that landslides mobilize to form debris flows by three processes: (a) widespread Coulomb failure within a sloping soil, rock, or sediment mass, (b) partial or complete liquefaction of the mass by high pore-fluid pressures, and (c) conversion of landslide translational energy to internal vibrational energy (i.e. granular temperature). These processes can operate independently, but in many circumstances they appear to operate simultaneously and synergistically. Early work on debris-flow mobilization described a similar interplay of processes but relied on mechanical models in which debris behavior was assumed to be fixed and governed by a Bingham or Bagnold rheology. In contrast, this review emphasizes models in which debris behavior evolves in response to changing pore pressures and granular temperatures. One-dimensional infinite-slope models provide insight by quantifying how pore pressures and granular temperatures can influence the transition from Coulomb failure to liquefaction. Analyses of multidimensional experiments reveal complications ignored in one-dimensional models and demonstrate that debris-flow mobilization may occur by at least two distinct modes in the field.},

To this end, the relative movement by rolling is related to the relative rotation between two particles with a common contact, which makes it possible to generalize the conservation law of angular momentum for a more general case than the moments can be transmitted through contacts. Not only the generation of large voids inside a shear band but also the high gradient of particle rotation along the shear band boundaries can be reproduced, in a manner quite similar to those of natural granular soils, when the rolling resistance at contacts is considered. The development of columns is a common feature that appears in the strain hardening process, and buckling of the columns parallels the development of shear bands.

abstract = {We introduce a new geometric method to generate sphere packings with restricted overlap values. Sample generation is an important, but time-consuming, step that precedes a calculation performed with the discrete element method (DEM). At present, there does not exist any software dedicated to DEM which would be similar to the mesh software that exists for finite element methods (FEM). A practical objective of the method is to build very large sphere packings (several hundreds of thousands) in a few minutes instead of several days as the current dynamic methods do. The developed algorithm uses a new geometric procedure to position very efficiently the polydisperse spheres in a tetrahedral mesh. The algorithm, implemented into YADE-OPEN DEM (open-source software), consists in filling tetrahedral meshes with spheres. In addition to the features of the tetrahedral mesh, the input parameters are the minimum and maximum radii (or their size ratio), and the magnitude of authorized overlaps. The filling procedure is stopped when a target solid fraction or number of spheres is reached. Based on this method, an efficient tool can be designed for DEMs used by researchers and engineers. The generated packings can be isotropic and the number of contacts per sphere is very high due to its geometric procedure. In this paper, different properties of the generated packings are characterized and examples from real industrial problems are presented to show how this method can be used. The current C++ version of this packing algorithm is part of YADE-OPEN DEM [20] available on the web (https://yade-dem.org).},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of idealized bonded-granulate cut slope subject to sudden strength reduction. A 2-D Distinct Element Method (DEM) has been used to carry out a simulation of full-process slope failure with focus on very-rapid and extremely-rapid landslide process. The numerical results show that during the landslide process: (1) the soil moves either in a rather random/chaotic way (diffuse failure) or in different curved shear bands (localized failure). The soil close to slope surface moves along downward slope while the soil close to the slope toe moves significantly in the horizontal direction. The landslide experiences very rapid flow most of the time, with its maximum velocity increaseing obviously with time at first to its peak value, then decreasing gradually to zero. (2) The soil close to slope undergo a repeated loading and unloading process, and an evident rotation of principal stresses. Their stress state may arrive slightly over the peak strength envelope as a result of extremely rapid flow. (3) There is little grain-size effect for the grains at low velocity, but an evident grain-size effect for the grains at high velocity, with large-size grains tending to move fast. (4) The post-failure inclination is much smaller than the peak/residual internal friction angle of the material. The post-failure slope surface passes through the centre of the initial slope surface instead of the initial slope toe.},

abstract = {The collapse and spreading of granular columns has been the subject of sustained interest in the last years from both mechanical and geophysical communities. Yet, in spite of this intensive research, the adequate rheology allowing for a reliable continuum modeling of the dynamics of granular column collapse is still open to discussion. Essentially, continuum models rely on shallow-water approximation for which dissipation and sedimentation processes are taken into account through the introduction of ad hoc laws. However, the rheological origin of the experimental scaling laws exhibited by the granular columns when spreading remains unclear. On these grounds, we adopt an alternative approach consisting of studying the collapse of columns of material obeying a Bingham rheology. Therefore we carried out series of numerical simulations using the Gerris Flow Solver solving the time dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in two dimensions for the specified rheology. We first check that the mass exhibit similar scaling laws as those shown by granular columns. Then we investigate in which extent rheological parameters do reflect on these scaling laws. A comparative analysis of Bingham and granular flow characteristics ensues. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Particles are modeled as circular, rigid disks, and interactions, which are governed by Coulomb friction, are controlled through the use of contact normal and shear springs. The rigid boundaries can be fixed or assigned a velocity-time relationship; a variety of displacement constraints and damping terms are also modeled. Dynamic equilibrium is fully satisfied, and the no penetration and no tension interparticle constraints are essentially maintained throughout the analysis. The resulting computer code, DDAD, can be used to efficiently perform analyses; it serves as a versatile tool for modeling the complex behavior of granular materials.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new approach is developed based on an endochronic density-dependent plasticity model for describing the isothermal deformation behavior of metal powder at low homologous temperature. As large deformations are observed in powder compaction processes, the endochronic constitutive model is presented based on large strain plasticity and an integration scheme is established for the rate constitutive equations. Endochronic constitutive equations are established based on coupling between deviatoric and hydrostatic behavior. The elastic response is stated in term of hypoelastic model and endochronic constitutive equations are stated in unrotated frame of reference. Finally, the algorithmic modulus consistent with numerical integration algorithm of constitutive equations is extracted. Although the concept of yield surface has not been explicitly assumed in endochronic theory, it is demonstrated that the cone-cap yield surface can be derived as a special case of the proposed endochronic model. The material parameters in endochronic model are calibrated for two samples of metal powder by fitting the model to reproduce data from true-triaxial compression experiments. The numerical schemes are examined for efficiency and accuracy in the modeling of three powder compaction components.},

First, the most important elements of the theory describing the flow of a cohensionless granular material down a rough bed are presented. Based on the depth-averaged model equations, an advanced numerical integration scheme is developed by making use of a Lagrangian representation (i. e., the grid moves with the deforming pile) and a finite difference approximation that handles the numerically two-dimensional problem accurately. Second, experiments are described that were conducted with a finite mass of granular material moving down, respectively, an inclined plane and a surface consisting of an inclined and a horizontal plane connected by a curved transition area; the initial geometry of the avalanche is generated by a spherical cap. Third, for a number of different experiments a comparison is carried out between the experimentally determined positions of the granular avalanche during its motion and the numerical prediction of these positions. It shows that the numerical results fit the experimental data surprisingly well.},

abstract = {The distribution of relative velocities between colliding particles in shear flows of inelastic spheres is analysed in the volume fraction range 0.40.7. This is in contrast to the Gaussian distribution for the normal relative velocity in an elastic fluid in the absence of shear. A composite distribution function, which consists of an exponential and a Gaussian component, is proposed to span the range of inelasticities considered here. In the case of rough particles, the relative velocity tangential to the surfaces at contact is also evaluated, and it is found to be close to a Gaussian distribution even for highly inelastic particles.Empirical relations are formulated for the relative velocity distribution. These are used to calculate the collisional contributions to the pressure, shear stress and the energy dissipation rate in a shear flow. The results of the calculation were found to be in quantitative agreement with simulation results, even for low coefficients of restitution for which the predictions obtained using the Enskog approximation are in error by an order of magnitude. The results are also applied to the flow down an inclined plane, to predict the angle of repose and the variation of the volume fraction with angle of inclination. These results are also found to be in quantitative agreement with previous simulations.},

This implies that the volume fraction is a constant in the leading approximation in an asymptotic analysis in small $\delta$.

abstract = {The hydrodynamics of the dense granular flow of rough inelastic particles down an inclined plane is analysed using constitutive relations derived from kinetic theory. The basic equations are the momentum and energy conservation equations, and the granular energy conservation equation contains a term which represents the dissipation of energy due to inelastic collisions. A fundamental length scale in the flow is the ‘conduction length’ $\delta$=(d/(1-en)1/2), which is the length over which the rate of conduction of energy is comparable to the rate of dissipation. Here, d is the particle diameter and en is the normal coefficient of restitution. For a thick granular layer with height h $\delta$, the flow in the bulk is analysed using an asymptotic analysis in the small parameter $\delta$/h. In the leading approximation, the rate of conduction of energy is small compared to the rates of production and dissipation, and there is a balance between the rate of production due to mean shear and the rate of dissipation due to inelastic collisions. A direct consequence of this is that the volume fraction in the bulk is a constant in the leading approximation. The first correction due to the conduction of energy is determined using asymptotic analysis, and is found to be O($\delta$/h)2 smaller than the leading-order volume fraction. The numerical value of this correction is found to be negligible for systems of practical interest, resulting in a lack of variation of volume fraction with height in the bulk.The flow in the ‘conduction boundary layers’ of thickness comparable to the conduction length at the bottom and top is analysed. Asymptotic analysis is used to simplify the governing equations to a second-order differential equation in the scaled cross-stream coordinate, and the resulting equation has the form of a diffusion equation. However, depending on the parameters in the constitutive model, it is found that the diffusion coefficient could be positive or negative. Domains in the parameter space where the diffusion coefficients are positive and negative are identified, and analytical solutions for the boundary layer equations, subject to appropriate boundary conditions, are obtained when the diffusion coefficient is positive. There is no boundary layer solution that matches the solution in the bulk for parameter regions where the diffusion coefficient is negative, indicating that a steady solution does not exist. An analytical result is derived showing that a boundary layer solution exists (diffusion coefficient is positive) if, and only if, the numerical values of the viscometric coefficients are such that volume fraction in the bulk decreases as the angle of inclination increases. If the numerical values of the viscometric coefficients are such that the volume fraction in the bulk increases as the angle of inclination increases, a boundary layer solution does not exist.The results are extended to dense flows in thin layers using asymptotic analysis. Use is made of the fact that the pair distribution function is numerically large for dense flows, and the inverse of the pair distribution function is used as a small parameter. This approximation results in a nonlinear second-order differential equation for the pair distribution function, which is solved subject to boundary conditions. For a dissipative base, it is found that a flowing solution exists only when the height is larger than a critical value, whereas the temperature decreases to zero and the flow stops when the height becomes smaller than this critical value. This is because the dissipation at the base becomes a larger fraction of the total dissipation as the height is decreased, and there is a minimum height below which the rate of production due to shear is not sufficient to compensate for the rate of dissipation at the base. The scaling of the minimum height with dissipation in the base, the bulk volume fraction and the parameters in the constitutive relations are determined. From this, the variation of the minimum height on the angle of inclination is obtained, and this is fo nd to be in qualitative agreement with previous experiments and simulations.},

abstract = {Shear flows of inelastic spheres in three dimensions in the volume fraction range 0.41 (smooth particles), and the normal coefficient of restitution en was varied in the range 0.6 = 0.5 and = 0.49. This indicates that the shear flow prevents ordering in a system of sufficiently large size. In a shear flow of inelastic particles, the strain rate and the temperature are related through the energy balance equation, and all time scales can be non-dimensionalized by the inverse of the strain rate. Therefore, the dynamics of the system are determined only by the volume fraction and the coefficients of restitution. The variation of the collision frequency with volume fraction and coefficient of restitution was examined. It was found, by plotting the inverse of the collision frequency as a function of volume fraction, that the collision frequency at constant strain rate diverges at a volume fraction ad decreases as the coefficient of restitution is decreased from en = 1; 0.8 for rough particles and is slightly larger for smooth particles. It is found that the dissipation rate and all components of the stress diverge proportional to the collision frequency in the close-packing limit. The qualitative behaviour of the increase in the stress and dissipation rate are well captured by results derived from kinetic theory, but the quantitative agreement is lacking even if the collision frequency obtained from simulations is used to calculate the pair correlation function used in the theory.},

abstract = {A perturbation expansion of the Boltzmann equation is used to derive constitutive relations for the granular flow of rough spheres in the limit where the energy dissipation in a collision is small compared to the energy of a particle.

A perturbation expansion is employed in the limit \$(1 - e\_n)\backslash,=\backslash,ǎrepsilon\^{}2 łl 1\$, and \$(1 - e\_t\^{}2) \backslash propto ǎrepsilon\^{}2 łl 1\$, so that \$e\_t\$ is close to \$\backslash pm 1\$. In the \&lsquo;rough\&rsquo; particle model, the normal coefficient of restitution \$e\_n\$ is close to 1, and the tangential coefficient of restitution \$e\_t\$ is close to 1. In the \&lsquo;partially rough\&rsquo; particle model, the normal coefficient of restitution \$e\_n\$ is close to 1; and the tangential coefficient of restitution \$e\_t\$ is close to \$-1\$ if the angle between the relative velocity vector and the line joining the centres of the particles is greater than the \&lsquo;roughness angle\&rsquo; (chosen to be \$(\backslash upi/4)\$ in the present calculation), and is close to 1 if the angle between the relative velocity vector and the line joining the centres is less than the roughness angle. The conserved variables in this case are mass and momentum; energy is not a conserved variable in the \&lsquo;adiabatic limit\&rsquo; considered here, when the length scale is large compared to the \&lsquo;conduction length\&rsquo;. The results for the constitutive relations show that in the Navier\&ndash;Stokes approximation, the form of the constitutive relation is identical to that for smooth particles, but the coefficient of shear viscosity for rough particles is 10\%\&ndash;50\% higher than that for smooth particles. The coefficient of bulk viscosity, which is zero in the dilute limit for smooth particles, is found to be non-zero for rough and partially rough particles, owing to the transport of energy between the translational and rotational modes. In the Burnett approximation, there is an antisymmetric component in the stress tensor for rough and partially rough particles, which is not present for smooth particles.The constitutive relations are used to analyse the \&lsquo;core region\&rsquo; of a steady granular flow down an inclined plane, where there is a local balance between the production of energy due to the mean shear and the dissipation due to inelastic collisions. It is found that realistic results, such as the decrease in density upon increase in the angle of inclination near close packing, are obtained for the rough and partially rough particle models when the Burnett coefficients are included in the stress tensor, but realistic results are not obtained using the constitutive relations for smooth particles. This shows that the flow dynamics is sensitive to the numerical values of the viscometric coefficients, and provides an indication of the minimal model required to capture the flow dynamics.},

abstract = {The granular shear flow of rough inelastic particles driven by flat walls is considered in the high-Knudsen-number limit, where the frequency of particle collisions with the wall is large compared to the frequency of inter-particle collisions. An asymptotic analysis is used in the small parameter \$ǎrepsilon = n d L\$ in two dimensions and \$ǎrepsilon = n d\^{}2 L\$ in three dimensions, where \$n\$ is the number of particles (per unit area in two dimensions and per unit volume in three dimensions), \$d\$ is the particle diameter and \$L\$ is the distance between the flat walls. In the collision model, the post-collisional velocity along the line joining the particle centres is \$-e\_n\$ times the pre-collisional velocity, and the post-collisional velocity perpendicular to the line joining the particle centres is \$-e\_t\$ times the pre-collisional value, where \$e\_n\$ and \$e\_t\$ are the normal and tangential coefficients of restitution. In the absence of binary collisions, a particle which has a random initial velocity tends to a final state where the translational velocities are zero, and the rotational velocity is equal to \$(-2V\_w/d)\$, where \$V\_w\$ is the wall velocity. When the effect of binary collisions is included, it is found that there are two possible final steady states, depending on the values of the tangential and normal coefficients of restitution. For certain parameter values, the final steady state is a stationary state, where the translational velocities of all the particles reduce to zero. For other parameter values, the final steady state is dynamic state where the translational velocity fluctuations are non-zero. In the dynamic state, the mean-square velocity has a power-law scaling with \$ǎrepsilon\$ in the limit \$ǎrepsilon \backslash rightarrow 0\$.

Here, we introduce a planar version in which the collapsing column is only one particle deep perpendicular to the plane of motion to make observations of the internal motion possible. This configuration also particularly lends itself to comparison with discrete element simulations which are performed in tandem. Our experiments confirm that this planar system displays all the same features as collapsing cylinders and rectangular blocks. In particular, the dominant dependence on the initial parameters of the column runout is through a power law of the initial height-to-width aspect ratio. Discrete element simulations, which are found to reproduce the experimental behavior very well, are then used to analyze the velocity field of the collapse process. A predominantly linear velocity profile is found in a moving layer over an evolving static pile.

abstract = {We report te results of an experimental investigation of the flow induced by the collapse of a column of granular material (glass beads of diameter d) over a horizontal surface. Two different setups are used, namely, a rectangular channel and a semicircular tube, allowing us to compare two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows, with particular focus on the internal flow structure. In both geometries the flow dynamics and the deposit morphologies are observed to depend primarily on the initial aspect ratio of the granular column a=Hi/Li, where Hi is the height of the initial granular column and Li its length along the flow direction. Two distinct regimes are observed depending on a: an avalanche of the column flanks producing truncated deposits for small a and a column free fall leading to conical deposits for large a. In both geometries the characteristic time scale is the free fall of the granular column Tc =√Hi. The flow initiated by Coulomb-like failure never involves the whole granular heap but remains localized in a surfac layer whose size and shape depend on a and vary in both space and time. Except in the vicinity of the pile foot where the flow is pluglike, velocity profiles measured at the side wall are identical to those commonly observed in steady granular surface flows: the velocity varies linearly with depth in the flowing layer and decreases exponentially with depth in the static layer. Moreover, the shear rate is constant, =0.3√g/ d, independent of the initial aspect ratio, the flow geometry, position along the heap, or time. Despite the rather complex flow dynamics, the scaled deposit height Hf/Li and runout distance $\Delta$L/Li both exhibit simple power laws whose exponents depend on a and on the flow geometry. We show that the physical origin of these power laws can be understood on the basis of a dynamic balance between acceleration, pressure gradient, and friction forces at the foot of the granular pile. Two asymptotic behaviors can be distinguished: the flow is dominated by friction forces at small a and by pressure forces at large a. The effect of the flow geometry is determined primarily by mass conservation and becomes important only for large a. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We study numerically a continuum model for granular flow, which covers the regime of fast dilute flow as well as slow dense flow up to vanishing velocity. The constitutive relations at small and intermediate densities are equivalent to those derived from kinetic theory of granular flow. The existence of an inherent instability due to the vanishing kinetic or collisional pressure for small granular temperatures requires a cross over from a collisional pressure to an a thermal yield pressure at densities close to random close packing. Contrary to a kinetic viscosity, the viscosity turns into a function diverging for small temperatures analogous to the diverging viscosities of liquids close to the glass transition. In this respect the presented model is a simplified version of a model of Savage (J Fluid Mech 377:1–26, 1998), which nevertheless recovers many aspects of dense granular flow. As examples we show simulations of sandpiles with predictable slopes, hopper simulations with mass and core flow and angle dependent critical sand heights in flows down an inclined plane. We solve the system of the strongly nonlinear singular hydrodynamic equations with the help of a newly developed nonlinear time stepping algorithm together with a finite volume space discretization. The numerical algorithm is implemented using a finite volume solver framework developed by the authors which allows discretization on cell-centred bricks in arbitrary domains.},

abstract = {The relationship between the design of powder mixers and their performance is of crucial importance for many industrial processes and yet is not well understood. Here the flow patterns generated by an agitator carrying a long flat blade were compared to those generated by a single ploughshare using positron emission particle tracking and DEM. The performances of these agitators were also assessed against those of multi-blade and multi-plough agitators. The powder flows created by the different designs had some qualitative similarities. Indeed, all the agitators were shown to generate a loop of circulation below the free surface of the bed. The radial support of each mixing element was also observed to act as a separatrix for the axial flow, leading to the formation of a loop of circulation on each side of the mixing elements, thus inhibiting axial convection of material. The single-blade agitators, be the flat blade or the plough, were found to induce a pulsing regime, this feature being also observe with the multi-blade agitators but with a lesser amplitude. For moderate agitator frequencies of rotation where inertial effects are negligible, fundamental characteristics of the flow patterns extracted from power spectra of axial displacements could be scaled with the number of blade passes.},

These nonlinear equations, classified as nonlinear friction equations, split naturally into two classes, depending on whether or not the temperature of their similarity solutions (homogeneous cooling states) reduce to zero in finite time. For both classes, we show uniqueness of the solution by proving decay to zero in the Wasserstein metric of any two solutions with the same mass and mean velocity. Furthermore, if the temperature of the similarity solution decays to zero in finite time, we prove, by computing explicitly upper bounds for the lifetime of the solution in terms of the length of the support, that the temperature of any other solution with initially bounded support must also decay to zero in finite time.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) takes advantages of both the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, so it is capable of handling many challenging engineering problems, such as the dynamic responses of reinforced concrete (RC) subjected to blast and impact loadings. However, it is time-consuming to discretize the steel reinforcement bars ("rebars") in RC by using MPM because the diameter of the steel bar is very small compared with the size of concrete. A hybrid Finite Element - Material Point (FEMP) method is proposed, in which the truss element in the traditional finite element method (FEM) is incorporated into the MPM to model the rebars. The proposed FEMP method is implemented in our three-dimensional material point method code, MPM3D®, and validated by several benchmark problems. Finally, it is applied to simulate the dynamic response of RC slab penetrated by projectile, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature. The proposed idea is applicable to incorporate other types of finite elements into MPM to take advantages of both FEM and MPM.},

@article{Linares-Guerrero2007,
abstract = {The unexpected behaviour of long-runout landslides has been a controversial subject of discussion in the geophysics community. In order to provide new insight into this phenomenon, we investigate the apparent reduction of friction resulting from the presence of a second species of smaller particles in the bulk of the granular material that forms the avalanche. Results obtained by means of a two-dimensional soft particle discrete element numerical simulation are presented. The numerical experiments consider an avalanche of two-size particles, originally placed over an inclined plane. The friction coefficient for the particle-particle and wall-particle contacts is held fixed. The granular mass is allowed to evolve with time, until it comes back to rest on a horizontal plane. The position of the centre of mass is located, such that the runout length Lcm/Hcm could be measured, with Lcm and Hcm being the horizontal distance travelled and the height lost by the avalanche centre of mass, respectively. Many simulations were performed keeping the area of the avalanche constant, varying only the area fraction of small particles. The results show that the runout length increases with the area fraction of small particles, reaching a maximum for a given area fraction of small particles. A detailed analysis of the particle distribution in the granular mass indicates that the apparent friction coefficient is affected by the formation of a layer of small particles at the base of the avalanche. This layer is identified as the source of 'lubrication'. Furthermore, since there is a dependence of the runout on the fall height and the volume in real avalanches, some simulations with different areas and different fall heights were performed. The results show a tendency of the runout to increase with area, and to decrease with the initial fall height, which is in agreement with what is observed for geological events. 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

The simulated results are compared with the results of triaxial compression tests on unsaturated compacted clay and qualitative similarities are obtained. Based on the simulation results, the yield stresses under different interparticle adhesive forces are determined and the collapse processes before and after yielding are investigated in detail. Moreover, the effect of initial void ratio and principal stress ratio on collapse is also investigated and discussed.

abstract = {Many natural hazards and industrial processes involve the collapse of granular particles onto a horizontal plane. Recent researches have studied the fundamental physics of the collapse of granular columns in experimental and numerical approaches. This paper presents a three-dimensional discrete element simulation of the axisymmetric spreading of initially vertical granular columns, in which the runout of the grains and their dynamic motion are continuously monitored during the course of collapse. Using a polar coordinate method to quantify the spread of the grains, the numerical results are in good agreement with previous research findings. The collapse dynamics is shown to be dependent on the initial geometry of the cylindrical column and independent of the inter-granular friction. Two distinct flow regimes are observed: a linear scaling and a power-law scaling are derived for the final runout distances of the columns. The problem is further explored by studying the effects of coefficient of restitution on the runout mechanics, in which energy dissipation at collisions has played an important role in determining the runout of the system. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new multiscale simulation approach is introduced that couples atomistic-scale simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) with continuum-scale simulations using the recently developed material point method (MPM). In MPM, material continuum is represented by a finite collection of material points carrying all relevant physical characteristics, such as mass, acceleration, velocity, strain and stress. The use of material points at the continuum level provides a natural connection with the atoms in the lattice at the atomistic scale. A hierarchical mesh refinement technique in MPM is presented to scale down the continuum level to the atomistic level, so that material points at the fine level in MPM are allowed to directly couple with the atoms in MD. A one-to-one correspondence of MD atoms and MPM points is used in the transition region and non-local elastic theory is used to assure compatibility between MD and MPM regions, so that seamless coupling between MD and MPM can be accomplished. A silicon single crystal under uniaxial tension is used in demonstrating the viability of the technique. A Tersoff-type, three-body potential was used in the MD simulations. The coupled MD/MPM simulations show that silicon under nanometric tension experiences, with increasing elongation in elasticity, dislocation generation and plasticity by slip, void formation and propagation, formation of amorphous structure, necking, and final rupture. Results are presented in terms of stress–strain relationships at several strain rates, as well as the rate dependence of uniaxial material properties. This new multiscale computational method has potential for use in cases where a detailed atomistic-level analysis is necessary in localized spatially separated regions whereas continuum mechanics is adequate in the rest of the material.},

abstract = {This paper experimentally investigates the rheology of dense granular flow through itssolid-like to fluid-like transition. Between the well-established flow regimes – quasi-static and grain-inertial – the physical description of the transition remains elusive. Our experiment uses a top-rotating torsional shear cell capable of ± 1 $\mu$m accuracy in height and 5 decades (10−3 − 100 rad s−1) in rotation rate. The data on beach sand shows that shear and normal stresses exhibit an inverse rate-dependence under a controlledvolume environment in the transitional regime, while in the limiting regimes the results are in agreement with previous work. Theshear-weakening stresses illustrate a previouslyunknown ‘dip’ with increasingshear rate. Under a controlled-pressure environment, however, the shear-compacting volume-fraction ‘peaks’ with increasing shear-rate. We combine these results from both configurations to infer a constitutive law based on a rate-invariant granular fluid compressibility. The formulation provides an equation-of-state for dynamic granular systems, with state variables of pressure, strain rate and free-volume-fraction. Fitting parameters from independent constant-volume and constant-pressure data shows good agreement in validating our model. Moreover, the degree of grain jaggedness is essential to the rate-dependence within the transitional regime. The results on the solid–fluid transitionmay elucidate the evolution of granular flow anisotropies.},

abstract = {The first detailed quantitative observations of the two-dimensional collapse of a granular column along a horizontal channel are presented for a variety of materials. Together with the complementary study for the axisymmetric situation, we conclude that for granular collapses the generally accepted approaches, that are highly dependent on frictional parameters, do not describe the main flow phenomena. The motion divides in two main flow regimes at a∼1.8, where the aspect ratio a=hidi and hi and di are the initial height and width of the column. We describe the details of collapse by emphasizing the sequential occurrence of a main spreading followed by a final avalanching phase. For the low a regime, a<1.8, we derive descriptions of the final geometry by direct physical arguments. For the large a regime, a>1.8, we determine that nearly all details of the collapse, including the position of the flow front as a function of time, the emplacement time, the self-similar final profiles, and especially their maximum vertical and horizontal extension, are established during the spreading phase and can be expressed in terms of the initial geometrical parameters but are independent of basal and internal friction parameters. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Through laboratory experiments we investigate inertial granular flows created by the instantaneous release of particulate columns into wide, rectangular channels. These flows are characterized by their unsteady motion, large changes of the free surface with time, and the propagation towards the free surface of an internal interface separating static and flowing regions. We present data for the time-dependent geometry of the internal interface and the upper, free surface for aspect ratios, a, in the range from 3 to 9.5 (where a=hi/di is the ratio of the initial height to basal width of the column). The data were analyzed by two different approaches. First, by integrating under the entire internal interface we obtained data for the static area, AD, as a function of time for different a. Second, in order to characterize vertical deposition rates, we measured the thicknesses of the flowing region, hF(x,t), and the static region, hD(x,t), at fixed horizontal positions, x, and time, t, since the initiation of the experiment. We also determined detailed velocity profiles with depth at distances scaled to the final maximum runout distance to analyze the kinematic behavior of the flowing layer. In the initial free-fall phase, the temporal variation of the static area is independent of hi and scales as gdit. During the subsequent lateral spreading phase, AD(t) varies linearly with time and the nondimensional deposition rate dAD/dt)/(gdi3)1/2 is a linear function of a. The thickness of the interface hD(x,t) at constant x depends on a and varies linearly with time. The local deposition rate h∂hD/∂t is not constant along the flow length. Data show that for the major part of the flow length ∂2hD/∂t∂x is constant. In the lateral spreading phase, the velocity profiles are characteristically linear with a basal exponential region, a few grains in thickness, which separates static from moving regions. The shear rate is a constant dependent on a modified initial height h̃i as (g/ h̃i1/2, where h̃i is a characteristic length scale in the system describing the fraction of the granular column actually involved in the flowing region. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We describe laboratory experiments of granular material flowing over an inclined plane covered by an erodible bed, designed to mimic erosion processes of natural flows travelling over deposits built up by earlier events. Two controlling parameters are the inclination of the plane and the thickness of the erodible layer. We show that erosion processes can increase the flow mobility (i.e., runout) over slopes with inclination close to the repose angle of the grains \$þeta\$r by up to 40\%, even for very thin erodible beds. Erosion efficiency is shown to strongly depend on the slope of the topography. Entrainment begins to affect the flow at inclination angles exceeding a critical angle \$þeta\$c \$\backslash simeq\$ \$þeta\$r/2. Runout distance increases almost linearly as a function of the thickness of the erodible bed, suggesting that erosion is mainly supply-dependent. Two regimes are observed during granular collapse: a first spreading phase with high velocity followed by a slow thin flow, provided either the slope or the thickness of the erodible bed is high enough. Surprisingly, erosion affects the flow mostly during the deceleration phase and the slow regime. The avalanche excavates the erodible layer immediately at the flow front. Waves are observed behind the front that help to remove grains from the erodible bed. Steep frontal surges are seen at high inclination angles over both rigid or erodible bed. Finally, simple scaling laws are proposed making it possible to obtain a first estimate of the deposit and emplacement time of a granular collapse over a rigid or erodible inclined bed.},

This effect increases when the aspect ratio of the granular mass increases. Comparison between discrete and continuum simulations makes it possible to show that the assumption of hydrostatic normal stress is essentially responsible of the limits of the LWA when the aspect ratio increases. The vertical acceleration, neglected in the vertical momentum equation, is shown to play a significant role when the aspect ratio increases. As a result, numerical simulations of real geophysical flows using thin layer models will be significantly improved if a new asymptotic analysis is performed including the effects of the vertical acceleration.},

Numerical simulations are performed with a single-relaxation-time lattice-Boltzmann method and with a large-eddy simulation turbulence model. These simulations present several not-fully-resolved issues for lattice-Boltzmann methods, which are briefly discussed in this paper.

abstract = {Granular materials will segregate by particle size when subjected to shear, as occurs, for example, in avalanches. The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of particles can be modeled by a nonlinear first order partial differential equation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position. While avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven shear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this paper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial value problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby verifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we consider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small particles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear cell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity profile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear function which separates the shear band from the rest of the material. Each solution of the initial value problem is nonstandard, involving curved characteristics in the exponential case, and a material interface with a jump in characteristic speed in the piecewise linear case.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments have shown that the steady flow of granular material down a rough inclined plane has a surface that is not parallel to the plane, but has a curvature across the slope with the height increasing toward the middle of the flow. We study this observation by postulating a new granular rheology, similar to that of a second order fluid. This model is applied to the experiments using a shallow water approximation, given that the depth of the flow is much smaller than the width. The model predicts that a second normal stress difference allows cross-slope height variations to develop in regions with considerable cross-slope velocity shear, consistent with the experiments. The model also predicts the development of lateral eddies, which are yet to be observed.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate two issues that are important to computational efficiency and reliability in fluid dynamic applications of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE): (1) Computational stability and accuracy of different lattice Boltzmann models and (2) the treatment of the boundary conditions on curved solid boundaries and their 3-D implementations. Three athermal 3-D LBE models (Q15D3, Q19D3, and Q27D3) are studied and compared in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The boundary treatment recently developed by Filippova and H\"{a}nel (1998, J. Comp. Phys.147, 219) and Mei et al. (1999, J. Comp. Phys.155, 307) in 2-D is extended to and implemented for 3-D. The convergence, stability, and computational efficiency of the 3-D LBE models with the boundary treatment for curved boundaries were tested in simulations of four 3-D flows: (1) Fully developed flows in a square duct, (2) flow in a 3-D lid-driven cavity, (3) fully developed flows in a circular pipe, and (4) a uniform flow over a sphere. We found that while the 15-velocity 3-D (Q15D3) model is more prone to numerical instability and the Q27D3 is more computationally intensive, the Q19D3 model provides a balance between computational reliability and efficiency. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrated that the boundary treatment for 3-D arbitrary curved geometry has second-order accuracy and possesses satisfactory stability characteristics.},

@article{Meriaux2008,
abstract = {This paper reports on laboratory experiments that were designed to investigate the collapse and quasi-static fall of dry cohesive granular columns. These experiments were compared with similar experiments that were performed with non-cohesive dry sand columns. A powder of gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate) was used to represent cohesive granular material. In all the experiments, the cohesive granular columns fractured and flowed in coherent blocks but, while faults remained steep in the quasi-static fall experiments, they flattened in the collapse experiments as the initial aspect ratio of the columns increased. Dilation was seen in the quasi-static fall experiments, while some air entrapment within the columns occurred in the collapse experiments. The final deposits of the cohesive granular columns were found to satisfy power law relationships as a function of the initial aspect ratio of the columns. Two asymptotes were found for the lower and higher range of initial aspect ratios, which varied between 0.5 and 8, respectively. When compared with the power law relationships found for dry noncohesive columns, the power dependence of the ratio of initial to final height and final runout to initial length with the aspect ratio of the columns was found to be similar. The prefactors of the power laws were found to slightly decrease with the increase of the cohesion or, equivalently, the decrease in grain size. Similar to the dry noncohesive case, the prefactors for the runout length were found to increase by a factor 2 with the increase of flow rate. When the collapse experiments were compared with the quasi-static fall experiments, a shift towards higher aspect ratios of the transition between the two asymptotic power laws was found. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The effects of the ambient fluid on granular flow dynamics are poorly understood and commonly ignored in analyses. In this article, we characterize and quantify these effects by combining theoretical and experimental analyses. Starting with the mixture theory, we derive a set of two-phase continuum equations for studying a compressible granular flow composed of homogenous solid particles and a Newtonian ambient fluid. The role of the ambient fluid is then investigated by studying the collapse and spreading of two-dimensional granular columns in air or water, for different solid particle sizes and column aspect (height to length) ratios, in which the front speed is used to describe the flow. The combined analysis of experimental measurements and numerical solutions shows that the dynamics of the solid phase cannot be explained if the hydrodynamic fluid pressure and the drag interactions are not included in the analysis. For instance, hydrodynamic fluid pressure can hold the reduced weight of the solids, thus inducing a transition from dense-compacted to dense-suspended granular flows, whereas drag forces counteract the solids movement, especially within the near-wall viscous layer. We conclude that in order to obtain a realistic representation of gravitational granular flow dynamics, the ambient fluid cannot be neglected.},

abstract = {This paper reports small-scale laboratory tests on granular avalanches of bidisperse materials made of fine particles and larger ones. These experiments were motivated by a recent study on the rheology of dense flowing snow which provided evidence for relevant similarities in flow behavior between bidisperse granular materials and dry cold snow [Rognon and others, J. Rheol., 52, 3 ([32])]. The mass proportion of fine particles in the initial binary mixture was systematically varied at constant initial released volume, and we measured the resulting flow depth, the avalanche front velocity and the final avalanche runout. In particular, we show that the avalanche mobility is largely increased, about 40\% in our tests, when the mass proportion in fine particles reaches a critical value, around 0.25 in our tests. The avalanche deposit is shallow and lengthened for this critical mass proportion in fine particles. The experimental results are interpreted by the existence of different avalanche mobility regimes on the basis of a heuristic model previously reported in literature. Finally, we discuss their possible implications for the dynamics of full-scale dry snow avalanches. 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper aims to quantitatively assess the application of kinetic-frictional model to simulate the motion of dry granular materials in dense condition, in particular, the annular shearing in Couette configuration. The weight of frictional stress was varied to study the contribution of the frictional stress in dense granular flows. The results show that the pure kinetic-theory-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (without frictional stress) over-predicts the dominant solids motion of dense granular flow while adding frictional stress [Schaeffer, D. G. (1987). Instability in the evolution equations describing incompressible granular flow. Journal of Differential Equations, 66(1), 19-50] with the solids pressure of [Lun, C. K. K., Savage, S. B., Jeffrey, D. J., \& Chepurniy, N. (1984). Kinetic theories for granular flow: Inelastic particles in Couette flow and slightly inelastic particles in a general flow field. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 140, 223-256] in the CFD model improves the simulation to better conform available experimental results. The results also suggest that frictional stress transmission plays an important role in dense granular flow and should not be neglected in granular flow simulations. Compatible simulation results to the experimental data are seen by increasing the weight of frictional stress to a factor of 1.25-1.5. These improved simulation results suggest the current constitutive relations (kinetic-frictional model) need to be improved in order to better reflect the real dense granular flow.},

abstract = {Failure in soils and the yielding mechanisms involved are essential to many civil engineering issues such as slope stability. Sudden collapse affecting slopes can be observed after rainfalls, sometimes leading to the devastating flow of a soil–water mixture. Although the notion of failure in soils was long described as a perfect plastic limit, the scientific community now recognizes that failure can occur well before the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is met. This paper considers the collapse of granular soils in relation to a sudden burst of kinetic energy. First, a correlation between the bursts of kinetic energy (leading to sudden avalanches) and the vanishing of the second-order work is clearly obtained from discrete element simulations. Then the link between the vanishing of the second-order work and the increase in kinetic energy is established from a theoretical approach. Finally, these results are confirmed based on laboratory experimental tests where the sudden collapse of soil specimens was obtained.},

abstract = {Discrete element modelling is a viable alternative to conventional continuum-based analysis for analysing problems involving localized deformations of particulate media. However, to aid in the interpretation of the results, it is useful to express the results of discrete element analyses in terms of the continuum parameters of stress and strain. A number of homogenization methods have been proposed to calculate strain in discrete systems; however, two significant limitations of these methods remain. First, none of these methods incorporate particle rotation effects satisfactorily, although significant particle rotation occurs in shear bands in both physical tests and numerical simulations of granular materials. Additionally, observations of the particle displacement fields in shear bands in granular materials indicate that the displacements within the localizations are erratic. Consequently, existing linear, local interpolation approaches produce substantial variations in the strain values calculated in adjacent elements in the region of localization, hindering clear visualization of the strain localization as it evolves. A new method of domain discretization for calculating strain is proposed. This method is capable of capturing particle rotation and employs a non-local meshfree interpolation procedure capable of smoothing the erratic displacements in strain localizations, which better defines their evolution. The proposed method is validated for problems involving both two and three dimensions. A number of methods are compared with the proposed method and pertinent insights are made.

abstract = {Changes in basal fluid pressure and normal flow depth in 2-phase granular mass flows, the equivalent coefficient of friction and the equivalent coefficient of friction between gravity centres before and after failure were investigated for pumiceous gravel, and a mixture of pumiceous gravel and volcanic ash by means of large-scale model flume tests. The proportion of finer soil particles, the inclination of slope segments, and the width of horizontal segments were selected as the controlled conditions. No excess of basal fluid pressure was observed in the pumiceous gravel. On the other hand, an excess of pressure head was generated in the mixture of pumiceous gravel and volcanic ash. This was due to the suspension of the fine particles in the pore fluid increasing its effective density and the quasi-undrained shear deformation due to the low permeability of the mixture in the mass of the granular flow during its motion. In tests with a slope of 30°, both the pumiceous gravel and the mixture of pumiceous gravel and volcanic ash travelled less distance in the narrow flume than in the wide one. This was likely because, in the wide flume, no clogging occurred where the width of the flume changed, and less frictional collisions against side-walls and resulting grains' contact took place. In tests with a narrow flume, the pumiceous gravel clogged and most of material was deposited around the constriction. However, the mixture passed through the constriction smoothly. This could be because less frictional resistance was generated in the mixture due to the lowering of effective stress between soil particles associated with the excess of pore-fluid pressure. Although the test on a slope of 35° had the largest potential energy before the release of the materials and the test on a slope of 25° had the least, the test with the 35-degree slope produced the largest equivalent coefficient of friction and the smallest value was obtained from the test with a 25-degree slope. This finding suggests that the dissipation of kinetic energy, especially in the vertical direction, due to the collisions and the following abrupt deformation around the connection of the flume between the slope and horizontal segments may play an important role in the travel distance.},

abstract = {Surface granular flow, comprising granular material flowing on the surface of a heap of the same material, occurs in several industrial and natural systems. The rheology of such a flow was investigated by means of measurements of velocity and number-density profiles in a quasi-two-dimensional rotating cylinder, half-filled with a model granular material \&ndash; monosize spherical stainless-steel particles. The measurements were made at the centre of the cylinder, where the flow is fully developed, using streakline photography and image analysis. The stress profile was computed from the number-density profile using a force balance which takes into account wall friction. Mean-velocity and root-mean-square (r.m.s.)-velocity profiles are reported for different particle sizes and cylinder rotation speeds. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when distance is scaled by the particle diameter \$d\$ and velocity by a characteristic shear rate \$ọt\backslash gamma\_C = [g\backslash sin(\backslash beta\_m-\backslash beta\_s)/d\backslash cos\backslash beta\_s]\^{}1/2\$ and the particle diameter, where \$\backslash beta\_m\$ is the maximum dynamic angle of repose and \$\backslash beta\_s\$ is the static angle of repose. The maximum dynamic angle of repose is found to vary with the local flow rate. The scaling is also found to work for the r.m.s. velocity profiles. The mean velocity is found to decay exponentially with depth in the bed, with decay length \$łambda=1.1d\$. The r.m.s. velocity shows similar behaviour but with \$łambda=1.7d\$. The r.m.s. velocity profile shows two regimes: near the free surface the r.m.s. velocity is nearly constant and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate, obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, is not constant anywhere in the layer and has a maximum which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the r.m.s. velocity profile. Above the transition point the velocity distributions are Gaussian and below the transition point the velocity distributions gradually approach a Poisson distribution. The shear stress increases roughly linearly with depth. The variation in the apparent viscosity \$\backslash eta\$ with r.m.s. velocity \$u\$ shows a relatively sharp transition at the shear-rate maximum, and in the region below this point the apparent viscosity \$\backslash eta\backslash sim u\^{}-1.5\$. The measurements indicate that the flow comprises two layers: an upper low-viscosity layer with a nearly constant r.m.s. velocity and a lower layer of increasing viscosity with a decreasing r.m.s. velocity. The thickness of the upper layer depends on the local flow rate and is independent of particle diameter while the reverse is found to hold for the lower-layer thickness. The experimental data is compared with the predictions of three models for granular flow.},

abstract = {A theoretical model based on a depth-averaged version of two-phase flow equations is developed to describe the initiation of underwater granular avalanches. The rheology of the granular phase is based on a shear-rate-dependent critical state theory, which combines a critical state theory proposed by Roux \&amp; Radjai (1998), and a rheological model recently proposed for immersed granular flows. Using those phenomenological constitutive equations, the model is able to describe both the dilatancy effects experienced by the granular skeleton during the initial deformations and the rheology of wet granular media when the flow is fully developed. Numerical solutions of the two-phase flow model are computed in the case of a uniform layer of granular material fully immersed in a liquid and suddenly inclined from horizontal. The predictions are quantitatively compared with experiments by Pailha, Nicolas \&amp; Pouliquen (2008), who have studied the role of the initial volume fraction on the dynamics of underwater granular avalanches. Once the rheology is calibrated using steady-state regimes, the model correctly predicts the complex transient dynamics observed in the experiments and the crucial role of the initial volume fraction. Quantitative predictions are obtained for the triggering time of the avalanche, for the acceleration of the layer and for the pore pressure.},

The depth-averaged mass and momentum equations for the solid and fluid components form a nonconservative system, where nonconservative terms involving the derivatives of the unknowns couple together the sets of equations of the two phases. The system can be shown to be hyperbolic at least when the difference of velocities of the two constituents is sufficiently small. We numerically solve the model equations in one dimension by a finite volume scheme based on a Roe-type Riemann solver. Well-balancing of topography source terms is obtained via a technique that includes these contributions into the wave structure of the Riemann solution.},

@article{Phillips2006,
abstract = {Understanding how granular materials flow remains an outstanding issue in both nature and industry where typically a range of particle sizes are involved. We present laboratory measurements of flows of binary mixtures of fine and coarse granular materials that show that their interaction can result in significantly increased mobility (the ratio of the run out distance for the centre of mass to the initial height of the centre of mass). At a fine material mass fraction [psi] (the ratio of the mass of fine particles to the total mass of the flow) of about 0.3, the flow mobility can be increased by up to a factor of 4 compared with the same mass of either all fine or all coarse material. Measurements of the distribution of the deposited fine and coarse particles along the length of the flow show that in low mobility flows the peak in deposition of fine and coarse particles occurs at different positions, whereas for high mobility flows there is a more uniform deposition of both particle sizes. We interpret the observations of flow mobility in terms of two primary mechanisms: at low [psi] the fine particles lubricate the flow of the coarse particles by rolling, whereas at high [psi] the presence of coarse particles reduces the inter-particle frictional losses in the flow. We use heuristic models to illustrate that these mechanisms are likely to occur in granular flows containing a wide range of grain sizes, noting that the detailed physical descriptions and mathematical models of these particle interactions are currently incomplete. These experimental observations challenge the traditional view that the extent of geophysical granular flows depends on their volume, in line with other recent studies of slumping granular materials. Recent studies which use a single particle size show strong dependence of flow run out on the initial aspect ratio of the release. Our results suggest that compositional effects in flows containing more than one particle size may be at least as important.},

This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid.

Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

Velocity distributions at the free surface are determined and in one case also at the bottom from below. Also measured is the settlement of the avalanche in the deposit.

abstract = {Site response analyses must take into account the nonlinear behavior of soils. This is typically achieved using an equivalent linear approach or using numerical analyses with an appropriate constitutive model. In this work a family of hypoplastic models is proposed for use in site response analyses. These nonlinear models use a rate-type tensorial equation and are capable of reproducing plastic deformation of soils for cyclic loading under both drained and undrained conditions. A methodology for the calibration of hypoplastic parameter for dynamic loading is proposed. The hypoplastic constitutive models are implemented in a finite element code and the site response of the Lotung downhole array site is used to validate the use of hypoplastic models for site response analysis. The hypoplastic models reproduce accurately site response at the Lotung site. The advantages and disadvantages of the hypoplastic models compared to other models are discussed.},

abstract = {The physics of ash-rich pyroclastic flows were investigated through laboratory dam break experiments using both granular material and water. Flows, of glass beads of 60-90 m in diameter generated from the release of initially fluidized, slightly expanded (2.5-4.5\%) columns behave as their inertial water counterparts for most of their emplacement. For a range of initial column height to length ratios of 0.5-3, both types of flows propagate in three stages, controlled by the time scale of column free fall (ho/g)1/2, where ho denotes column height and g denotes gravitational acceleration. Flows first accelerate as the column collapses. Transition to a second, constant velocity phase occurs at a time t/(ho/g)1/2 1.5. The flow velocity is then U 2(gho)1/2, larger than that for dry (initially nonfluidized) granular flows. Transition to a last, third phase occurs at t/(ho/g)1/2 4. Granular flow behavior then departs from that of water flows as the former steadily decelerates and the front position varies as t1/3, as in dry flows. Motion ceases at t/(ho/ g)1/2 6.5 with normalized runout x/ho 5.5-6. The equivalent behavior of water and highly concentrated granular flows up to the end of the second phase indicates a similar overall bulk resistance, although mechanisms of energy dissipation in both cases would be different. Interstitial air-pARTICLE viscous interactions can be dominant and generate pore fluid pressure sufficient to confer a fluid-inertial behavior to the dense granular flows before they enter a granular-frictional regime at late stages. Efficient gas-pARTICLE interactions in dense, ash-rich pyroclastic flows may promote a water-like behavior during most of their propagation. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The collapse of a granular column in a viscous liquid is experimentally investigated. The morphology of the deposits is shown to be mainly controlled by the initial volume fraction of the granular mass and not by the aspect ratio of the column, an observation which differs from dry granular collapse. Two different regimes are identified corresponding to initially loose and dense packings. Loose packings give rise to thin and long deposits, the dynamics being fast. A positive liquid pressure is measured below the column. For dense packings, the runout distance is twice less, the flow is slow, and a negative pore pressure is measured during the flow. These observations suggest that the dynamics of the granular collapse in a fluid is strongly affected by the dilatancy or contractancy behavior of the granular medium.},

Here, we analyze large-scale three-dimensional discrete-element method (DEM) simulations of different granular flows and show that an approximate "granular element" defined at the scale of observed dynamical correlations (roughly three to five pARTICLE diameters) has a reasonable continuum interpretation. By viewing all the simulations as an ensemble of granular elements which deform and move with the flow, we can track material evolution at a local level. Our results confirm some of the hypotheses of classical plasticity theory while contradicting others and suggest a subtle physical picture of granular failure, combining liquid-like dependence on deformation rate and solid-like dependence on strain. Our computational methods and results can be used to guide the development of more realistic continuum models, based on observed local relationships between average variables.},

abstract = {A theory intended for slow, dense flows of cohesionless granular materials is developed for the case of planar deformations. By considering granular flows on very fine scales, one can conveniently split the individual pARTICLE velocities into fluctuating and mean transport components, and employ the notion of granular temperature that plays a central role in rapid granular flows. On somewhat larger scales, one can think of analogous fluctuations in strain rates. Both kinds of fluctuations are utilized in the present paper. Following the standard continuum approach, the conservation equations for mass, momentum and particle translational fluctuation energy are presented. The latter two equations involve constitutive coefficients, whose determination is one of the main concerns of the present paper. We begin with an associated flow rule for the case of a compressible, frictional, plastic continuum. The functional dependence of the flow rule is chosen so that the limiting behaviours of the resulting constitutive relations are consistent with the results of the kinetic theories developed for rapid flow regimes. Following Hibler (1977) and assuming that there are fluctuations in the strain rates that have, for example, a Gaussian distribution function, it is possible to obtain a relationship between the mean stress and the mean strain rate. It turns out, perhaps surprisingly, that this relationship has a viscous-like character. For low shear rates, the constitutive behaviour is similar to that of a liquid in the sense that the effective viscosity decreases with increasing granular temperature, whereas for rapid granular flows, the viscosity increases with increasing granular temperature as in a gas. The rate of energy dissipation can be determined in a manner similar to that used to derive the viscosity coefficients. After assuming that the magnitude of the strain-rate fluctuations can be related to the granular temperature, we obtain a closed system of equations that can be used to solve boundary value problems. The theory is used to consider the case of a simple shear flow. The resulting expressions for the stress components are similar to models previously proposed on a more ad hoc basis in which quasi-static stress contributions were directly patched to rate-dependent stresses. The problem of slow granular flow in rough-walled vertical chutes is then considered and the velocity, concentration and granular temperature profiles are determined. Thin boundary layers next to the vertical sidewalls arise with the concentration boundary layer being thicker than the velocity boundary layer. This kind of behaviour is observed in both laboratory experiments and in granular dynamics simulations of vertical chute flows.},

abstract = {Summary This paper describes a model to predict the flow of an initially stationary mass of cohesion-less granular material down rough curved beds. This work is of interest in connection with the motion of rock and ice avalanches and dense flow snow avalanches. The constitutive behaviour of the material making up the pile is assumed to be described by a Mohr-Coulomb criterion while the bed boundary condition is treated by a similar Coulomb-type basal friction law assumption. By depth averaging the incompressible conservation of mass and linear momentum equations that are written in terms of a curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the curved bed, we obtain evolution equations for the depthh and the depth averaged velocityu. Three characteristic length scales are defined for use in the non-dimensionalization and scaling of the governing equations. These are a characteristic avalanche lengthL, a characteristic heightH, and a characteristic bed radius of curvatureR. Three independent parameters emerge in the non-dimensionalized equations of motion. One, which is the aspect ratio e-H/L, is taken to be small. By choosing different orderings for the other two, the tangent of the bed friction angle d and the characteristic non-dimensional curvature ?=L/R, we can obtain different sets of equations of motion which appropriately display the desired importance of bed friction and bed curvature effects. The equations, correct to order e for moderate curvature, are discretized in the form of a Lagrangian-type finite difference representation which proved to be successful in the earlier studies of Savage and Hutter [24] for granular flow down rough plane surfaces. Laboratory experiments were performed with plastic pARTICLEs flowing down a chute having a bed made up of a straight, inclined portion, a curved part and a horizontal portion. Numerical solutions are presented for conditions corresponding to the laboratory experiments. It is found that the predicted temporal-evolutions of the rear and front of the pile of granular material as well as the shape of the pile agree quite well with the laboratory experiments.},

It turns out that there are two qualitatively different kinds of instability; which appears first depends on the parameters of the constitutive relations. If one kind appears first, then in a constitutive test a period of inhomogeneous deformation is predicted to occur before the formation of shear bands. If the other kind appears first, then shear bands are predicted to form in an approximately homogeneous sample.

The flow is recorded through a transparent side-wall by a high-speed camera, which is able to capture 1,825 pictures in a second. Due to the high frame rate of the camera, several flow features can be observed. Quantitative statements can be made by analysing the images with a pattern matching algorithm. This provides us with flow-normal velocity profiles with a very high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that even on flat surfaces, velocity profiles are strongly changing through the flow and for the range of investigated chute angles (from 26 to 36) clear trends can be recognised. In the head of the avalanche the velocity is highest, decreasing continuously over the length of the avalanche. Thus, the investigated granular avalanches stretch through the flow. The experimental method allows us to study the evolution of characteristic flow properties such as depth averaged velocity, slip velocity, surface velocity, shear rates or flow depth.

Analysis shows that solutions of the model equations exhibit a subcritical Hopf bifurcation in which stable, steady sliding can transition to cyclical, stick-slip motion. Numerical computations confirm the analytical predictions of the parameter values at which bifurcation occurs. The existence of stick-slip behavior in part of the parameter space is particularly noteworthy because, unlike stick-slip behavior in classical models, here it arises in the absence of a reversible (elastic) driving force. Instead, the driving force is static (gravitational), mediated by the effects of pore-pressure diffusion on frictional resistance.},

abstract = {The deformation characteristics of ductile polycrystalline materials at elevated temperatures were studied numerically by considering a square segment of material subjected to different stress modes. The initial polycrystalline microstructure was generated numerically. The micromechanical modeling of the deformation was performed using the material point method. The constitutive behavior was taken to be isotropic, elastic-plastic with linear hardening. To effectively simulate the deformation at high homologous temperatures, the grain boundary region was assumed to be a layer of finite thickness, bearing a lower yield strength than the interior of the grain. Complex deformation patterns were observed. The deformation is dominated by the formation of zones of concentrated instantaneous deformation along grain boundaries. These zones form paths that vary with time, and depend on the microstructure and macroscopic loading mode. The macroscopic stress, as well as the microscopic stresses at various locations within the grain boundary and grain interior, were seen to correlate with the instantaneous deformation pattern throughout the deformation history. For the sample analyzed, with a relatively small macroscopic strain of 0.01, the grain boundary region experienced plastic strains as large as 0.20, a result which provided a strong indication that failure will initiate in the grain boundaries. Implications of this modeling study to actual creep deformation and failure are discussed.},

If grain-shape, grain-size and relative density is considered in a proper manner, a relatively simple constitutive law with only three constants (friction coefficient, shear and normal stiffness) is sufficient for the reproduction of the observed stress-deformation behaviour. The paper describes the procedures, how to get information about grain-shape and size and how to generate samples with realistic grain-shape, size and relative density under the pre-requisite to optimize the computational effort. The procedure was successfully tested using five different lab test: soil-dump test, soil-pouring test, oedometer test, triaxial test and multi-stage shear test, also under consideration of different initial densities.},

Both the effects of the initial geometry and the effects of the details of the interactions between the grains are investigated. The scaling of the runout distance shows both a linear and a power-law dependence on the aspect ratio of the initial column, in agreement with previous findings (Balmforth and Kerswell in J.

The latter controls the prefactor of the scaling, the effective frictional properties of the flow, and its internal structure.

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the collapse and spreading of granular columns onto a horizontal plane using the Contact Dynamics method are presented. The results are in agreement with previous experimental work. The final shape of the deposit appears to depend only on the initial aspect ratio a of the column. The normalized runout distance has a power-law dependence on the aspect ratio a, a dependence incompatible with a simple friction model. The dynamics of the collapse is shown to be mostly controlled by a free fall of the column. Energy dissipation at the base of the column can be described simply by a coefficient of restitution. Hence the energy available for the sideways flow is proportional to the initial potential energy E0. The dissipation process within the sideways flow is approximated well by basal friction, unlike the behaviour of the runout distance. The proportion of mass ejected sideways is shown to play a determining role in the spreading process: as a increases, the same fraction of initial potential energy E0 drives an increasing proportion of the initial mass against friction. This gives a possible explanation for the power-law dependence of the runout distance on a. We propose a new scaling for the runout distance that matches the data well, is compatible with a friction model, and provides a qualitative explanation of the column collapse. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The prediction of the runout length L of large dry debris flows has long been the subject of a considerable research effort, primarily due to the obvious concern caused by their destructive power. One seemingly well established feature is the increase of the mobility \$\backslash calM\$ of a rock avalanche, defined as the ratio of the runout distance to the fall height, with its volume V. The physical nature of this lubrication mechanism remains however controversial. In this paper, we analyse field data and discrete numerical simulations of granular flows and demonstrate the geometrical origin of the apparent enhancement of the mobility with the volume. We evidence the intertwined role of volume and topography and show the existence of two contributions in the runout, defining two flow regimes: one dominated by sliding, in which the runout is independent of V, and another dominated by spreading, in which the runout is strongly dependent on V. In the light of these results, the search of a volume dependent lubrication mechanism appears to be an ill-posed problem.},

An increasingly large number of grains are overloaded in the sense that they are found to carry a stress ratio above the Coulomb yield threshold of the whole packing. Using this property, we introduce a coarse-graining length scale at which all stress ratios are below the packing yield threshold. We show that this length increases with the slope angle and jumps to a length comparable to the depth of the granular bed at an angle below the angle of repose. This transition coincides with the onset of dilation in the packing.

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) is a computationally effective particle method with mathematical roots in both particle-in-cell and finite element-type methods. The method has proven to be extremely useful in solving solid mechanics problems involving large deformations and/or fragmentation of structures, problem domains that are sometimes problematic for finite element-type methods. Recently, the MPM community has focused significant attention on understanding the basic mathematical error properties of the method. Complementary to this thrust, in this paper we show how spatial and temporal errors are typically coupled within the MPM framework. In an attempt to overcome the challenge to analysis that this coupling poses, we take advantage of MPM's connection to finite element methods by developing a 'moving-mesh' variant of MPM that allows us to use finite element-type error analysis to demonstrate and understand the spatial and temporal error behaviors of MPM. We then provide an analysis and demonstration of various spatial and temporal errors in MPM and in simplified MPM-type simulations. Our analysis allows us to anticipate the global error behavior in MPM-type methods and allows us to estimate the time-step where spatial and temporal errors are balanced. Larger time-steps result in solutions dominated by temporal errors and show second-order temporal error convergence. Smaller time-steps result in solutions dominated by spatial errors, and hence temporal refinement produces no appreciative change in the solution. Based upon our understanding of MPM from both analysis and numerical experimentation, we are able to provide to MPM practitioners a collection of guidelines to be used in the selection of simulation parameters that respect the interplay between spatial (grid) resolution, number of particles and time-step. 2009 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Experimental observations of the collapse of initially static columns of sand in axisymmetric and two-dimensional geometries are presented. The experiments were carried out using cylinders and rectangular tanks 30 to 60 cm tall, and cover aspect ratios between 0.5 and 20, where the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the initial height to horizontal extent of the column. The final positions of sand grains from different points initially on the outer surface of the columns are mapped. For all axisymmetric columns the point of maximum runout is found to originate from a point at fractional height 0.74 $\backslash$pm 0.03 of the initial vertical height of the column, independent of the aspect ratio. For two-dimensional columns the corresponding point is 0.65 $\backslash$pm 0.07. Collapses of columns of water-saturated sand into water display a different form of flow, which leads to there being no such well-defined point. In this case, grains from all but the innermost, basal areas of the initial column can end up in the outermost region of the final deposit. For collapses in air and aspect ratios greater than 1, the detail of the initial geometry is relatively insignificant in determining the shape of the final deposit. The results of this and previous studies thus have general applicability, even to situations with less initial symmetry.

abstract = {PARTICLE-size segregation is a common feature of dense gravity-driven granular free-surface flows, where sliding and frictional grain - grain interactions dominate. Provided that the diameter ratio of the pARTICLEs is not too large, the grains segregate by a process called kinetic sieving, which, on average, causes the large pARTICLEs to rise to the surface and the small grains to sink to the base of the avalanche. When the flowing layer is brought to rest this stratification is often preserved in the deposit and is known by geologists as inverse grading. Idealized experiments with bi-disperse mixtures of differently sized grains have shown that inverse grading can be extremely sharp on rough beds at low inclination angles, and may be modelled as a concentration jump or shock. Several authors have developed hyperbolic conservation laws for segregation that naturally lead to a perfectly inversely graded state, with a pure phase of coarse pARTICLEs separated from a pure phase of fines below, by a sharp concentration jump. A generic feature of these models is that monotonically decreasing sections of this concentration shock steepen and eventually break when the layer is sheared. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the subsequent breaking, which is important for large-pARTICLE recirculation at the bouldery margins of debris flows and for fingering instabilities of dry granular flows. We develop an exact quasi-steady travelling wave solution for the structure of the breaking/recirculation zone, which consists of two shocks and two expansion fans that are arranged in a 'lens'-like structure. A high-resolution shock-capturing numerical scheme is used to investigate the temporal evolution of a linearly decreasing shock towards a steady-state lens, as well as the interaction of two recirculation zones that travel at different speeds and eventually coalesce to form a single zone.

The runout distance is found to increase as a power law with the aspect ratio of the column, and, surprisingly, for a given aspect ratio and packing fraction, it may be similar in the grain-inertial and fluid-inertial regimes but with considerably longer duration in the latter case. We show that the effect of fluid in viscous and fluid-inertial regimes is to both reduce the kinetic energy during collapse and enhance the flow by lubrication during spread. Hence, the runout distance in a fluid may be below or equal to that in the absence of fluid due to compensation between those effects.},

The amplitude of the 2nd harmonic exhibits beatings (typical of nonlinear processes in dispersive media), which are observed not as a function of the distance from emitter, but with increasing amplitude of the primary (pump) shear wave. The effect is attributed to varying contribution of clapping intergrain contacts to the total nonlinearity of the medium with increasing pump amplitude, which modifies the effective length of the nonlinear interaction. This is consistent with the idea that in granular assemblages there is an important amount of contacts loaded much weaker than in average.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical investigation of the behaviour of dry granular flows generated by the collapse of prismatic columns via 3D Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations in plane strain conditions. Firstly, by means of dimensional analysis, the governing parameters of the problem are identified, and variables are clustered into dimensionless independent and dependent groups. Secondly, the results of the DEM simulations are illustrated. Different regimes of granular motion were observed depending on the initial column aspect ratio. The profiles observed at different times for columns of various aspect ratios show to be in good agreement with available experimental results. Thirdly, a detailed analysis of the way energy is dissipated by the granular flows was performed. It emerges that most of the energy of the columns is dissipated by inter-particle friction, with frictional dissipation increasing with the column aspect ratio. Also, the translational and rotational components of the kinetic energy of the flows, associated to particle rotational and translational motions respectively, were monitored during the run-out process. It is found that the rotational component is negligible in comparison with the translational one; hence in order to calculate the destructive power of a granular flow slide, only the translational contribution of the kinetic energy is relevant. Finally, a methodology is presented to calculate the flux of kinetic energy over time carried by the granular flow through any vertical section of interest. This can be related to the energy released by landslide induced granular flows impacting against engineering structures under the simplifying assumption of neglecting all structure-flow interactions. This represents the first step towards achieving a computational tool quantitatively predicting the destructive power of a given flow at any location of interest along its path. This could be useful for the design of engineering works for natural hazard mitigation. To this end, also the distribution of the linear momentum of the flow over depth was calculated. It emerges that the distribution is initially bilinear, due to the presence of an uppermost layer of particles in an agitated loose state, but after some time becomes linear. This type of analysis showcases the potential of the Distinct Element Method to investigate the phenomenology of dry granular flows and to gather unique information currently unachievable by experimentation.},

abstract = {Particulate organic matter concentrations determined at the outlet of a low-sloped combined sewer are observed to increase significantly in the very early stage of storm runoff events. It is found that this is not a result from scouring of actual deposited sediments in the sewer (which are granular), but from the dynamic behaviour of a distinct component of the sewage flow itself. During low flows in dry weather, a part of the coarsest material present in normal sanitary sewage (primarily organic debris such as human and food wastes, of about millimetric size and larger) settles and leaves the main body of the flow, but does not reach the sewer bottom to deposit there. The lowest part of the flowing sewage acts in this case as a temporary storage of highly polluting matter, as its longitudinal velocity is lower than the one of the remaining flow. An explanation for the building of these 'dense undercurrents' is formulated, based on a difference between free settling in the main body of flow and hindered settling near the bottom. Although this still merits further confirmation, it is likely that the process which maintains coarse solids in suspension in the undercurrent is a lift force induced by shear in the near-bed zone. The collapse of the undercurrent and the subsequent release of polluting material into the whole water column has been observed in the considered sewer to occur when bed shear stress exceeds about 1.1-1.2 N/m2. This low value can explain flushing effects occurring frequently during rainy period, or even at peak dry weather flows. On the basis of properties illustrated in this study, a number of management options can be considered for revised day-to-day operation of low-sloped interceptor sewers where dense undercurrents are likely to develop.},

The experiments have been performed with three size classes of spherical glass beads, and poppy seeds (non-spherical). Flow states and flow regimes are categorized in the phase space spanned by the supercritical Froude number and the minimum width of the contraction. A theoretical explanation is given for the formation of steady reservoirs in the contraction observed in experiments using glass beads and water. For this purpose, the classical, one-dimensional shallow-water theory is extended to include frictional and porosity effects. The occurrence of the experimentally observed flow states and regimes can be understood by introducing integrals of acceleration. The flow state with a steady reservoir arises because friction forces in the reservoir are much smaller than in other parts of the flow. Three-dimensional discrete-pARTICLE simulations quantitatively agree with the measured granular flow data, and the crucial part of the theoretical frictional analysis is clearly confirmed. The simulations of the flow further reveal that porosity and frictional effects interact in a complicated way. Finally, the numerical database is employed to investigate the rheology in a priori tests for several constitutive models of frictional effects.},

abstract = {Fluidized bed technology has diverse industrial applications ranging from the gasification of coal in the power industry to chemical reactions for the plastic industry. Due to their complex chaotic non-linear behaviour understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour in fluidized beds is often limited to pressure drop measurements and a mass balance of the system. Computational fluid dynamics has the capability to model multiphase flows and can assist in understanding gas-solid fluidized beds by modeling their hydrodynamics. The multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid model, extended and validated here improves on the kinetic theory of granular flow by including a closure term for the quasi-static stress associated with the long term pARTICLE contact at high solid concentrations. Similar quasi-static models have been widely applied to slow granular flow such as chute flow, flow down an incline plane and geophysical flow. However combining the kinetic theory of granular flow and the quasi-static stress model for the application of fluidized beds is limited. The objective of the present paper is to compare two quasi-static stress models to the experimental fluidized bed data of Bouillard et al. [4]. A quasi-static granular flow model (QSGF) initially developed by Gray and Stiles [18] is compared to the commonly used Srivastava and Sundaresan [37]. Both models show good agreement with the experimental bubble diameter and averaged porosity profiles. However only the QSGF model shows a distinct asymmetry in the bubble shape which was documented by Bouillard et al. [4].},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the rapid fluid-like flow of a finite mass of granular material down a chute with partial lateral confinement. The chute consists of a section inclined at 40 to the horizontal, which is connected to a plane run-out zone by a smooth transition. The flow is confined on the inclined section by a shallow parabolic cross-slope profile. Photogrammetric techniques have been used to determine the position of the evolving boundary during the flow, and the free-surface height of the stationary granular deposit in the run-out zone. The results of three experiments with different granular materials are presented and shown to be in very good agreement with numerical simulations based on the Savage-Hutter theory for granular avalanches. The basal topography over which the avalanche flows has a strong channelizing effect on the inclined section of the chute. As the avalanche reaches the run-out zone, where the lateral confinement ceases, the head spreads out to give the avalanche a characteristic `tadpole' shape. Sharp gradients in the avalanche thickness and velocity began to develop at the interface between the nose and tail of the avalanche as it came to rest, indicating that a shock wave develops close to the end of the experiments.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation of an idealized rapidly sheared granular flow was performed to test the predictions of a model based on the kinetic theory of dry granular media. Glass ballotini beads were placed in an annular shear cell and the lower boundary rotated to induce a shearing motion in the bed. A single pARTICLE was tracked using the positron emission pARTICLE tracking (PEPT) technique, a method that determines the location of a pARTICLE through the triangulation of gamma photons emitted by a radioactive tracer pARTICLE. The packing fraction and velocity fields within the three-dimensional flow were measured and compared to the predictions of a model developed using the conservation and balance equations applicable to dissipative systems, and solved incorporating constitutive relations derived from kinetic theory. The comparison showed that kinetic theory is able to capture the general features of a rapid shear flow reasonably well over a wide range of shear rates and confining pressures.},

abstract = {The transport properties of wet granular materials in a shear cell apparatus have been studied. If the pARTICLEs are wet, the flow becomes more viscous forming liquid bridges between pARTICLEs. The dynamic liquid bridge forces are considered as the cohesive forces between pARTICLEs to restrict their movements. The cohesive forces make the pARTICLEs stick tighter with each other and hamper the movement of pARTICLEs. The mixing and transport properties are influenced seriously by the amount of moisture added in the flow. This paper discusses a series of experiments performed in a shear cell device with five different moisture contents using 3-mm glass spheres as the granular materials. The motion of granular materials was recorded by a high-speed camera. Using the image processing technology and pARTICLE tracking method, the average and fluctuation velocities in the streamwise and transverse directions could be measured. The self-diffusion coefficient could be found from the history of the pARTICLE displacements. The self-diffusion coefficients and fluctuations in the streamwise direction were much larger than those in the transverse direction. Three bi-directional stress gages were installed to the upper wall to measure the normal and shear stresses of the granular materials along the upper wall. For wetter granular material flows, the fluctuation velocities and the self-diffusion coefficients were smaller.},

abstract = {The non-coaxiality of the directions of principal stresses and principal plastic strain rates in granular soils under stress rotations has long been observed and recognized in soil tests using both simple shear and hollow cylinder apparatuses. A few constitutive theories have also been proposed in the literature to account for the effect of stress rotations and the subsequent non-coaxial soil behaviour, particularly in the context of shear band analysis. However, the lack of corresponding general numerical methods makes it difficult to investigate the influence of non-coaxial stress-strain behaviour on the results of geotechnical boundary value problems. This paper presents a numerical evaluation of a class of non-coaxial, elastic-plastic models that are developed by combining the conventional plastic potential theory and the double shearing theory. The general non-coaxial constitutive theories are first formulated and then a finite element implementation of the theories is carried out. To evaluate the non-coaxial theories, the problem of simple shear of soils is chosen to investigate the predicted behaviour of soils under simple shear loading conditions where the axes of principal stresses rotate. In particular, the influence of initial stress states and the degree of non-coaxiality are examined. It is found that the numerical results predicted using the non-coaxial model are in general agreement with the experimental observations reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The main research subject in the continuum approach of dense granular materials is the derivation of constitutive relations needed for closure. These relations have been derived using many kinds of model. The brief outlines of these models, simulation results for mechanical fields using these relations and the experimental verifications are presented. There are not so many as these studies explain correctly the detailed behaviors of granular materials. It would be necessary to verify the simulation results based on these models by direct comparison with the experimental data performed under the same conditions as the calculation. The reason for the lack of simulation results to describe behaviors of dense granular materials is the difficulty in calculating the mechanical fields in which statics and dynamics are simultaneously involved under real-life boundary values using these constitutive relations. We describe briefly our constitutive equations based on the mechanical data of dense granular materials obtained by distinct element method calculation and show the simulation results of real flow fields (granular collapse and heap) using our constitutive equations by the smoothed pARTICLE hydrodynamics (SPH) method and the verification by the direct comparison with experimental data presented in a previous paper. It seems that a Lagrangian approach, e.g. the SPH method, is a simple and reliable method for the calculation of dense granular materials using these complicated constitutive relations under real-life boundary conditions.},

abstract = {The particle-in-cell method (PIC), especially the latest version of it, the material point method (MPM), has shown significant advantage over the pure Lagrangian method or the pure Eulerian method in numerical simulations of problems involving large deformations. It avoids the mesh distortion and tangling issues associated with Lagrangian methods and the advection errors associated with Eulerian methods. Its application to multiphase flows or multi-material deformations, however, encounters a numerical difficulty of satisfying continuity requirement due to the inconsistence of the interpolation schemes used for different phases. It is shown in Section 3 that current methods of enforcing this requirement either leads to erroneous results or can cause significant accumulation of errors. In the present paper, a different numerical method is introduced to ensure that the continuity requirement is satisfied with an error consistent with the discretization error and will not grow beyond that during the time advancement in the calculation. This method is independent of physical models. Its numerical implementation is quite similar to the common method used in Eulerian calculations of multiphase flows. Examples calculated using this method are presented.},

In the proposed strategy, the dynamic analysis of saturated soil and solid bodies is handled by the CMPM and the original MPM respectively. The interaction between saturated soil and solid bodies is simulated by a new contact algorithm which effectively avoids the interpenetration between saturated soil and solid bodies.

The effect of permanent indentation after impact is represented by a correction to the radius of curvature. The effect of material softening due to plastic flow is represented by a correction to the elastic moduli. The proposed TFD model is accurate, and is validated against nonlinear finite element analyses involving plastic flows in both the loading and unloading conditions.

It is shown that DEM is an effective method to study the fundamentals of granular flow at a pARTICLE or microscopic scale. By use of the continuum approach, granular flow can also be described at a continuum or macroscopic scale. Macroscopic quantities such as velocity and stress can be obtained by use of such computational method as FEM. However, this approach depends on the constitutive relationship of materials and ignores the effect of microscopic structure of granular flow. The combined approach of DEM and averaging method can overcome this problem. The approach takes into account the discrete nature of granular materials and does not require any global assumption and thus allows a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of granular flow. However, it is difficult to adapt this approach to process modelling because of the limited number of pARTICLEs which can be handled with the present computational capacity, and the difficulty in handling non-spherical pARTICLEs. Further work is needed to develop an appropriate approach to overcome these problems.},

Plast. 22 (2006) 628-653] to study the slow flow of a frictional, dense granular material. Although most models pertain only to the fully developed granular flow, the application of the dilatant double shearing model is shown to be valid from the onset of granular flow to the fully developed granular flow. In this paper, we use the finite element program ABAQUS/Explicit to numerically simulate the granular Couette flow and the frictional granular flow in a silo. For the granular Couette flow, the relative density variation and the velocity profile obtained by using the dilatant double shearing model are in good quantitative agreement with those obtained from a DEM simulation. For the frictional flow in a silo, the major principal stress directions are obtained at various time steps after the onset of silo discharge. We find that, in the hopper zone, the arching of the granular material between the sloping hopper walls is clearly demonstrated by the change in direction of the major principal stress. We also compare the pressure distribution along the wall before and after the onset of silo discharge. The numerical results show that the dilatant double shearing model is capable of capturing the essential features of the frictional granular flow.},
